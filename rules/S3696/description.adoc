Just because you _can_ stick your hand in a blender, that doesn't mean you _should_. Similarly, you _can_ <code>throw</code> anything, but that doesn't mean you _should_ <code>throw</code> something that's not derived at some level from <code>std::exception</code>.

If you can't find an existing exception type that suitably conveys what you need to convey, then you should extend <code>std::exception</code> to create one.

Specifically, part of the point of throwing exceptions is to communicate about the conditions of the error, but primitives have far less ability to communicate meaningfully than <code>exception</code>s. And, the creation of some other object type could itself <code>throw</code> an exception, resulting in program termination.

Further, <code>catch</code>ing non-exception types is painful and fraught with the potential for (further) error.

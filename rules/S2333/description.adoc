The methods declared in an <code>interface</code> are <code>public</code> and <code>abstract</code> by default. Any variables are automatically <code>public static final</code>. There is no need to explicitly declare them so.

Since annotations are implicitly interfaces, the same holds true for them as well.

Similarly, the <code>final</code> modifier is redundant on any method of a <code>final</code> class, and <code>private</code> is redundant on the constructor of an <code>Enum</code>.

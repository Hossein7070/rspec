A macro is a textual replacement, which means that it's not respecting the type system, it's not respecting scoping rules... There is no reason not to use a constant instead.

Most of the time, a macro can be replaced by a <code>constexpr</code> declaration (a constant that is guaranteed to be computed during compilation). If your compiler is too old to properly handle <code>constexpr</code>, you may use <code>const</code> instead.

If you have a series of related integer macros, you might also consider replacing them by an <code>enum</code>.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#define MAX_MEMORY 640 // Noncompliant

#define LEFT   0 // Noncompliant
#define RIGHT  1 // Noncompliant
#define JUMP   2 // Noncompliant
#define SHOOT  3 // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
constexpr size_t MAX_MEMORY = 640;
enum class Actions {Left, Right, Jump, Shoot};
----

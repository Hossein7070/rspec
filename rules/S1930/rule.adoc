While you can use as many <code>page</code> directives as you like, it is more readable to set multiple page attributes in a single directive.

The exception to this rule is when multiple packages are being imported. In that case, imports may be done in separate directives and all other attributes should be set in a single, additional directive.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
<%@ page session="false" %>
<%@ page import="java.util.*" %>
<%@ page errorPage="error.jsp" %> <!-- Noncompliant -->
<%@ page import="java.text.*" %>
----


== Compliant Solution

----
<%@ page session="false"
                   errorPage="error.jsp" %>
<%@ page import="java.util.*" %>
<%@ page import="java.text.*" %>

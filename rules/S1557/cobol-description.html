<p>Using &lt;code&gt;DISTINCT&lt;/code&gt; in SQL &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statements should be avoided. Not only is this command to remove duplicates not efficient, but a &lt;code&gt;SELECT DISTINCT&lt;/code&gt; query indicates that something is not quite right. That is because using the &lt;code&gt;DISTINCT&lt;/code&gt; keyword means that redundant data is being pulled from the database and then discarded.</p>

<p>&lt;code&gt;ini_set&lt;/code&gt; changes the value of the given configuration option for the duration of the script’s execution. While there may be a reason to do this, you should make sure that it’s a very good reason indeed, because this is the sort of "magic" change which can cause severe teeth-gnashing and hair tearing when the script needs to be debugged.</p>
<p>For instance, if the user explicitly turns logging on for a script, but then the script itself uses &lt;code&gt;ini_set('display_errors', 0);&lt;/code&gt; to turn logging back off, it is likely that every other aspect of the environment will be examined before, in desperation, the script is read to figure out where the logging is going.</p>

<pre>
ini_set('display_errors', 0);  // Noncompliant

<p>A section that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities.
Such sections inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.
Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller sections which focus on well-defined tasks. Those smaller sections will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.</p>

<p>The standard mentions that the line continuation character (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;) should be immediately followed by a newline or be the very last character of the file in order for the lines to be joined.</p>
<p>Several compilers relax this requirement by allowing whitespace after the &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; character, but this is not portable because other compilers may not do the same.</p>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
// There should be no whitespace after the '\'
#define FOO BAR \
            BAZ
</pre>

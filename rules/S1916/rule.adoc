The standard mentions that the line continuation character (<code>\</code>) should be immediately followed by a newline or be the very last character of the file in order for the lines to be joined.

Several compilers relax this requirement by allowing whitespace after the <code>\</code> character, but this is not portable because other compilers may not do the same.


== Compliant Solution

----
// There should be no whitespace after the '\'
#define FOO BAR \
            BAZ

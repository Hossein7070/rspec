<code>file_uploads</code> is an on-by-default PHP configuration that allows files to be uploaded to your site. Since accepting -candy- files from strangers is inherently dangerous, this feature should be disabled unless it is absolutely necessary for your site.

This rule raises an issue when <code>file_uploads</code> is not explicitly disabled.

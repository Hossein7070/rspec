<p>HTML5â€™s cross-window messaging adds the ability to send messages directly from one window (or iframe) to another, without having to go through a server. This makes it easier to write interesting and responsive web sites, but adds vulnerability as well, since the same-origin policy does not apply here. For that reason, cross-window messaging listeners should always check message origins and use only those from trusted sites.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue on each cross-window messaging listener that does not check message origins.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
window.addEventListener("message", function (event){  // Noncompliant
  // ...
}, false);
</pre>

<p>If you have no intention of writting an &lt;code&gt;HttpSession&lt;/code&gt; object to file, then storing non-&lt;code&gt;serializable&lt;/code&gt; objects in it may not seem like a big deal. But whether or not you explicitly serialize the session, it may be written to disk anyway, as the server manages its memory use in a process called "passivation". Further, some servers automatically write their active sessions out to file at shutdown &amp; deserialize any such sessions at startup.</p>
<p>The point is, that even though &lt;code&gt;HttpSession&lt;/code&gt; does not &lt;code&gt;extend Serializable&lt;/code&gt;, you must nonetheless assume that it will be serialized, and understand that if youâ€™ve stored non-serializable objects in the session, errors will result.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class Address {
  //...
}

//...
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("address", new Address());  // Noncompliant; Address isn't serializable
</pre>

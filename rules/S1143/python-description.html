<p>Using &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block suppresses the propagation of any unhandled exception which was raised in the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; blocks. It will also ignore their return statements.</p>
<p>&lt;code&gt;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit">SystemExit</a>&lt;/code&gt; is raised when &lt;code&gt;sys.exit()&lt;/code&gt; is called. &lt;code&gt;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt">KeyboardInterrupt</a>&lt;/code&gt; is raised when the user asks the program to stop by pressing interrupt keys. Both exceptions are expected to propagate up until the application stops. It is ok to catch them when a clean-up is necessary but they should be raised again immediately. They should never be ignored.</p>
<p>If you need to ignore every other exception you can simply catch the &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; class. However you should be very careful when you do this as it will ignore other important exceptions such as &lt;code&gt;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError">MemoryError</a>&lt;/code&gt;</p>
<p>In python 2 it is possible to raise old style classes. You can use a bare &lt;code&gt;except:&lt;/code&gt; statement to catch every exception. Remember to still reraise &lt;code&gt;SystemExit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KeyboardInterrupt&lt;/code&gt;.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a jump statement (&lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;) would force the control flow to leave a finally block.</p>

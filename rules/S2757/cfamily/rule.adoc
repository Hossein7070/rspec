The use of operators pairs (<code>=+</code>) where the reversed, single operator was meant (<code>+=</code>) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.

This rule raises an issue when <code>=+</code>, <code>=-</code>, <code>=!</code>, <code>=&</code>, <code>=*</code>, <code>+=+</code>,  and <code>-=-</code> are used without any space between the two operators and when there is at least one whitespace after.

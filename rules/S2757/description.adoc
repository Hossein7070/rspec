The use of operators pairs ( <code>=\+</code>, <code>=\-</code> or <code>=\!</code> ) where the reversed, single operator was meant (<code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code> or <code>\!=</code>) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.

This rule raises an issue when <code>=+</code>, <code>=-</code>, or <code>=!</code> is used without any spacing between the two operators and when there is at least one whitespace character after.

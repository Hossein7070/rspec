Calling the <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> or <code>NOT</code> prefix operator twice does nothing: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are typically caused by accidentally double-tapping the key in question without noticing.

Either this is a bug, if the operator was actually meant to be called once, or misleading if done on purpose.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
IF NOT ( NOT foo = 5 ) THEN  -- Noncompliant
  value := ++1;              -- Noncompliant
END IF;
----

== Compliant Solution

----
IF foo = 5 THEN  -- Compliant
  value := +1;       -- Compliant
END IF;
----

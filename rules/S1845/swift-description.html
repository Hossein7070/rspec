<p>Looking at the set of methods in a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;extension&lt;/code&gt; and finding two methods that differ only by capitalization is confusing to users of the class. It is similarly confusing to have a method and a field or a case which differ only in capitalization.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class SomeClass {
    var lookUp = false
    func lookup(){ }        // Noncompliant; method name differs from field name only by capitalization
    func lookUP(){ }        // Noncompliant; method name differs from field and another method name only by capitalization
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class SomeClass {
    var lookUp = false
    func getLookUp(){ }
}
</pre>

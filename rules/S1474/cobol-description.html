<p>The worst nightmare of every COBOL maintenance programmer is a program where you have to follow 12 concatenated &lt;code&gt;PERFORM&lt;/code&gt; statements before you get to the actual processing. This is considered to be the &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt;-less version of spaghetti programming.</p>
<p>This situation can be avoided by having a mainline procedure at the beginning of the procedure division which concentrates all program control, and which reads like a map of the program. This mainline procedure should be free from detailed operations such as moving fields, calculations, I/O operations, and so on.</p>
<p>This rule helps ensure that most program control is concentrated in the mainline procedure (the first one in the program) by preventing the other procedures from having more than a predefined threshold of "PERFORM" statements.</p>

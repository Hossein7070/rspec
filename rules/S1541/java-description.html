<p>The cyclomatic complexity of methods should not exceed a defined threshold.
Complex code can perform poorly and will in any case be difficult to understand and therefore to maintain.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>While having a large number of fields in a class may indicate that it should be split, this rule nonetheless ignores high complexity in &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; methods.</p>

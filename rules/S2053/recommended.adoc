== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* use hashing functions generating their own salt or generate a long random salt of at least 32 bytes.
* the salt is at least as long as the resulting hash value.
* provide the salt to a safe hashing function such as PBKDF2.
* save both the salt and the hashed value in the relevant database record; during future validation operations, the salt and hash can then be retrieved from the database. The hash is recalculated with the stored salt and the value being validated, and the result compared to the stored hash.

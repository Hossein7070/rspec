There's no valid reason to test <code>this</code> with <code>instanceof</code>. The only plausible explanation for such a test is that you're executing code in a parent class conditionally based on the kind of child class <code>this</code> is. But code that's specific to a child class should be _in_ that child class, not in the parent.

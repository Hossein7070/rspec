Trigraphs are denoted by a sequence of 2 question marks followed by a specified third character (e.g. ??- represents a '~' (tilde) character and ??) represents a ']'). They can cause accidental confusion with other uses of two question marks.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
static const char str[] = "(Date should be in the form ??-??-??)"; // Noncompliant. Evaluates to "(Date should be in the form ~~]"
----


== Compliant Solution

----
static const char str[] = "(Date should be in the form ?" "?-?" "?-?" ?)";  // adjacent string literals concatenated at compile time
static const char str2[] = "(Date should be in the form ?-?-?)"; // problem avoided by eliminating 2nd '?' in each sequence
static const char str3[] = "(Date should be in the form ? ?-? ?-? ?)"; // problem avoided by spacing '?'s out

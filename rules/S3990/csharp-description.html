<p>Assemblies should conform with the Common Language Specification (CLS) in order to be usable across programming languages. To be compliant an assembly has to indicate it with &lt;code&gt;System.CLSCompliantAttribute&lt;/code&gt;.</p>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
using System;

[assembly:CLSCompliant(true)]
namespace MyLibrary
{
}
</pre>

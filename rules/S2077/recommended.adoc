== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Avoid building queries manually using formatting technics. If you do it anyway, do not include user input in this building process.
* Use https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet[parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures] whenever possible.
* You may also use ORM frameworks such as Hibernate which, if used correctly, reduce injection risks.
* Avoid executing SQL queries containing unsafe input in stored procedures or functions.
* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet[Sanitize] every unsafe input.

You can also reduce the impact of an attack by using a database account with low privileges.

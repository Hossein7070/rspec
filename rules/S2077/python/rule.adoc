Formatting strings used as SQL queries is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9019[CVE-2018-9019]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7318[CVE-2018-7318]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5611[CVE-2017-5611]

SQL queries often need to use a hardcoded SQL string with a dynamic parameter coming from a user request. Formatting a string to add those parameters to the request is a bad practice as it can result in an https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection[SQL injection]. The safe way to add parameters to a SQL query is to use SQL binding mechanisms.

Note that this rule does not detect SQL injections.

This rule flags the execution of formatted SQL via Django APIs. The goal is to guide security code reviews and to prevent a common bad practice.

A string is considered formatted if it uses one of the following operations:

* <code>str.format(...)</code>
* <code>str % str</code>
* <code>str + str</code>
* <code>f"SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE name = '\{value\}'"</code>
* <code>F"SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE name = '\{value\}'"</code>

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Avoid building queries manually using formatting. If you do it anyway, do not include user input in this building process.
* Use https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet[parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures] whenever possible.
* Avoid executing SQL queries containing unsafe input in stored procedures or functions.
* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet[Sanitize] every unsafe input.
* Follow https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/security/#sql-injection-protection[Django best practices].

You can also reduce the impact of an attack by using a database account with low privileges.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
from django.db import models
from django.db import connection
from django.db import connections
from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL

value = input()


class MyUser(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)


def query_my_user(request, params, value):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("{0}".format(value))  # Sensitive

    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/expressions/#raw-sql-expressions

    RawSQL("select col from %s where mycol = %s and othercol = " + value, ("test",))  # Sensitive

    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/querysets/#extra

    MyUser.objects.extra(
        select={
            'mycol':  "select col from sometable here mycol = %s and othercol = " + value}, # Sensitive
           select_params=(someparam,),
        },
    )
----

== Compliant Solution

----
cursor = connection.cursor(prepared=True)
sql_insert_query = """ select col from sometable here mycol = %s and othercol = %s """

select_tuple = (1, value)

cursor.execute(sql_insert_query, select_tuple) # Compliant, the query is parameterized
connection.commit()

<p>&lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt; terminates the current application. Since it does not carry any information as to what went wrong it is not a good way to handle errors and will most likely confuse the user, therefore it is highly recommended never to use the &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt; statement.</p>

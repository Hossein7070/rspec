== Exceptions

Even if testing the equality of a variable against null doesn't do exactly what most JavaScript developers believe, usage of <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> is tolerated in such context. In the following case, if <code>foo</code> hasn't been initialized, its default value is not <code>null</code> but <code>undefined</code>. Nevertheless <code>undefined == null</code>, so JavaScript developers get the expected behavior.

----
if(foo == null) {...}

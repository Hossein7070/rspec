<code>NCHAR</code> and <code>NVARCHAR2</code> lengths must be given in characters, not bytes. This is partly because a single character may occupy more than a single byte in memory. Specify the field length in bytes, and theoretically your value could overrun the field, but instead Oracle simply refuses to run the code. Specify it in characters, and Oracle will allocate the appropriate number of bytes to store the requested number of characters. Trying to specify the length semantics in bytes will result in the <code>PLS-00639: NCHAR/NVARCHAR2 cannot be byte length semantics</code> exception being raised.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
DECLARE
  foo NCHAR(42 BYTE); -- Noncompliant - raises PLS-00639
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
----


== Compliant Solution

----
DECLARE
  foo NCHAR(42);      -- Compliant
  bar NCHAR(42 CHAR); -- Also compliant, as an alternative
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/

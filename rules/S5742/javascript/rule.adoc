== Sensitive Code Example

In Express.js application the code is sensitive if the https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect-ct[expect-ct] middleware is not used:
----
const express = require('express');
const expectCt = require('expect-ct');

let app = express(); // Sensitive
----

== Compliant Solution

In Express.js application the https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect-ct[expect-ct] middleware is the standard way to implement expect-ct. Usually, the deployment of this policy starts with the report only mode (<code>enforce: false</code>) and with a low <code>maxAge</code> (the number of seconds the policy will apply) value and next if everything works well it is recommended to block future connections that violate Expect-CT policy (<code>enforce: true</code>) and greater value for maxAge directive:
----
const express = require('express');
const expectCt = require('expect-ct');

let app = express(); // Compliant

app.use(expectCt({
  enforce: true,
  maxAge: 86400
}));

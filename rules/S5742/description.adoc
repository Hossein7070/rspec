https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency[Certificate Transparency] (CT) is an open-framework to protect against identity theft when  certificates are issued. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority[Certificate Authorities] (CA) electronically sign certificate after verifying the identify of the certificate owner. Attackers use, among other things, social engineering attacks to trick a CA to correctly verifying a spoofed identity/forged certificate. 

CAs implement Certificate Transparency framework to publicly log the records of newly issued certificates, allowing the public and in particular the identity owner to monitor these logs to verify that his identify was not usurped.

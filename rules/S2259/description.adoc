A pointer to null (the 0 memory address) should never be dereferenced/accessed. Doing so will at best cause abrupt program termination, without the ability to run any cleanup processes. At worst, it could expose debugging formation that would be useful to an attacker or it could allow an attacker to bypass security measures.

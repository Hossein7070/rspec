Recursion is a powerful tool, but it can be tricky to get right. Getting it wrong can lead to stack overflow errors and cause system problems. Even when you do get it right, recursive code can be difficult to understand, perhaps leading to maintenance problems in the future. Therefore recursion should be avoided in general and used only with due deliberation and caution when it is strictly necessary.

This rule checks for direct recursion (when a function calls itself).

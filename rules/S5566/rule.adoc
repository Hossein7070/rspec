For loops are a very powerful and versatile tool that can be used for many purposes. This flexibility comes with drawbacks:

* It is very easy to make a small mistake when writing them,
* They are relatively verbose to write,
* They do not express the intent of the code, the reader has to look at loop details to understand what the loop does.

There are algorithms that encapsulate a <code>for</code> loop and give it some meaning (<code>std::all_of</code>, <code>std::count_if</code>, <code>std::remove_if</code>...). These algorithms are well tested, efficient and explicit and therefore should be your first choice.

If you just want to iterate on all elements of a sequence, you have two options:

* Range-based for loops, which were introduced in C++11 and will run through all elements of a sequence
* <code>std::for_each</code>, an algorithm that performs the same operation between two iterators (allowing more flexibility, for instance by using <code>reverse_iterator</code>s, or with a variant that can loop in parallel on several elements at a time).

This rule raises an issue when a <code>for</code>-loop goes through all consecutive elements of a sequence (eg: containers, objects with begin() and end() member functions), and deals only with the current element without side-effects on the rest of the sequence.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int f(vector<int> &v) {

  for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) { // Noncompliant
    if (*it > 0) {
      cout << "Positive number : " << *it << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "Negative number : " << *it << endl;
    }
  }

  auto sum = 0;
  for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) { // Noncompliant
    sum += *it;
  }
  return sum;
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void displayNumber(int i) {
  if (i > 0) {
    cout << "Positive number : " << i << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "Negative number : " << i << endl;
  }
}

void f(vector<int> &v) {

  for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), displayNumber);

  auto sum = 0;
  for (auto elt : v) {
    sum += elt;
  }
  return sum;
  // An even better way to write this would be:
  // return std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0); 
}

There should not be any statements after <code>EXIT PROGRAM</code>. Such statements cannot be reached, and are therefore dead code. Dead code makes a program more complex and therefore more difficult to maintain.

      MOVE A TO B.
      EXIT PROGRAM.   >NOK as the following "MOVE B TO C" statement will never be called
      MOVE B TO C.

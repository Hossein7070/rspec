== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Regarding the execution of unknown code, the best solution is to not run code provided by an untrusted source. If you really need to do it, run the code in a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)[sandboxed] environment. Use jails, firewalls and whatever means your operating system and programming language provide (example: https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEC54-J.+Create+a+secure+sandbox+using+a+security+manager[Security Managers] in java, https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp[iframes] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy[same-origin policy] for javascript in a web browser).

Do not try to create a blacklist of dangerous code. It is impossible to cover all attacks that way.

Avoid using dynamic code APIs whenever possible. Hard-coded code is always safer.

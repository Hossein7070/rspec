<p>Executing code dynamically is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9807">CVE-2017-9807</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9802">CVE-2017-9802</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some APIs enable the execution of dynamic code by providing it as strings at runtime. These APIs might be useful in some very specific meta-programming use-cases. However most of the time their use is frowned upon as they also increase the risk of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection">Injected Code</a>. Such attacks can either run on the server or in the client (exemple: XSS attack) and have a huge impact on an application’s security.</p>
<p>This rule marks for review each occurrence of such dynamic code execution. This rule does not detect code injections. It only highlights the use of APIs which should be used sparingly and very carefully.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
<li>the executed code may come from an untrusted source and hasn’t been sanitized.</li>
<li>you really need to run code dynamically.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Regarding the execution of unknown code, the best solution is to not run code provided by an untrusted source. If you really need to do it, run the code in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxed</a> environment. Use jails, firewalls and whatever means your operating system and programming language provide (example: <a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEC54-J.+Create+a+secure+sandbox+using+a+security+manager">Security Managers</a> in java, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp">iframes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a> for javascript in a web browser).</p>
<p>Do not try to create a blacklist of dangerous code. It is impossible to cover all attacks that way.</p>
<p>Avoid using dynamic code APIs whenever possible. Hard-coded code is always safer.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>No issue will be created if one of the methods above is called with a hard-coded type/method/field/property/interface/module name. There can be no injection in this specific scenario.
Example:</p>
<pre>
assembly.GetType("MyHardcodedType")
</pre>
<p>No issue will be created if one of the methods is called on an instance of <em>Type</em> created using <em>GetType</em> operator. There can be no injection in this specific scenario.
Example:</p>
<pre>
typeof(CustomType).GetMethods();
</pre>

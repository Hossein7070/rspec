<p>The old, much-derided &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Calendar&lt;/code&gt; classes have always been confusing and difficult to use properly, particularly in a multi-threaded context. &lt;code&gt;JodaTime&lt;/code&gt; has long been a popular alternative, but now an even better option is built-in. Java 8’s JSR 310 implementation offers specific classes for:</p>
<p>||Class||Use for||
|LocalDate|a date, without time of day, offset, or zone|
|LocalTime|the time of day, without date, offset, or zone|
|LocalDateTime|the date and time, without offset, or zone|
|OffsetDate|a date with an offset such as +02:00, without time of day, or zone|
|OffsetTime|the time of day with an offset such as +02:00, without date, or zone|
|OffsetDateTime|the date and time with an offset such as +02:00, without a zone|
|ZonedDateTime|the date and time with a time zone and offset|
|YearMonth|a year and month|
|MonthDay|month and day|
|Year/MonthOfDay/DayOfWeek/…​|classes for the important fields|
|DateTimeFields|stores a map of field-value pairs which may be invalid|
|Calendrical|access to the low-level API|
|Period|a descriptive amount of time, such as "2 months and 3 days"|</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Date now = new Date();  // Noncompliant
DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("dd.MM.yyyy");
Calendar christmas  = Calendar.getInstance();  // Noncompliant
christmas.setTime(df.parse("25.12.2020"));
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();  // gets calendar date. no time component
LocalTime now2 = LocalTime.now(); // gets current time. no date component
LocalDate christmas = LocalDate.of(2020,12,25);
</pre>

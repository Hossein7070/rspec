== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Protection against CSRF attacks is strongly recommended:
** to be activated by default for all https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Safe_methods[unsafe HTTP methods].
** implemented, for example, with an unguessable CSRF token

* Of course all sensitive operations should not be performed with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Safe_methods[safe HTTP] methods like <code>GET</code> which are designed to be used only for information retrieval.

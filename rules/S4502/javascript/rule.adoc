== Sensitive Code Example

https://www.npmjs.com/package/csurf[Express.js CSURF middleware] protection is not found on an unsafe HTTP method like POST method:

----
let csrf = require('csurf');
let express = require('express');

let csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });

let app = express();

// Sensitive: this operation doesn't look like protected by CSURF middleware (csrfProtection is not used)
app.post('/money_transfer', parseForm, function (req, res) { 
  res.send('Money transferred');
});
----

Protection provided by https://www.npmjs.com/package/csurf[Express.js CSURF middleware] is globally disabled on unsafe methods:

----
let csrf = require('csurf');
let express = require('express');

app.use(csrf({ cookie: true, ignoreMethods: ["POST", "GET"] })); // Sensitive as POST is unsafe method

== Ask Yourself Whether

* The application discloses that a username exists in its database: most of the time it's possible to avoid this kind of leak except for the "registration/sign-on" part of a website because in this case the user must choose a valid username (not already taken by another user).
* There is no rate limiting and CAPTCHA protection in place for requests involving a username.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

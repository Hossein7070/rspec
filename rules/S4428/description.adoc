The <code>PartCreationPolicyAttribute</code> attribute, which is part of the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), is used to specify how the exported object will be created. Therefore it doesn't make sense not to export this a class with this attribute using the <code>ExportAttribute</code> attribute.

This rule raises an issue when a class is marked as shared with a <code>PartCreationPolicyAttribute</code> but lacks a <code>ExportAttribute</code>.

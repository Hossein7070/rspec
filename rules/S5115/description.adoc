Checking users' permissions by comparing specific attributes such as their name to a hardcoded value is not flexible enough and can create security vulnerabilities. It prevents system administrators from changing users' permissions when needed (example: when their account has been compromised). 

This rule raises an issue whenever an equality comparison is made between authenticated user's attributes and a hardcoded value.

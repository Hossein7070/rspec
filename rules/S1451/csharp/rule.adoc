Each source file should start with a header stating file ownership and the license which must be used to distribute the application. 
This rule must be fed with the header text that is expected at the beginning of every file.

The <code>headerFormat</code> must end with an empty line if you want to have an empty line between the file header and the first line for your source file (<code>using</code>, <code>namespace</code>...).

For example, if you want the source file to look like this

----
// Copyright (c) SonarSource. All Rights Reserved. Licensed under the LGPL License.  See License.txt in the project root for license information.

namespace Foo
{
}
----
then the <code>headerFormat</code> parameter should end with an empty line like this

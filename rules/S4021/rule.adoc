The <code>SafeHandle</code> class provides a simpler and safer way to manage the life cycle of objects which contains un-managed pointers (<code>IntPtr</code>). When converting to <code>SafeHandle</code> all calls to <code>GC.KeepAlive</code> should be removed because they become unnecessary and could confuse maintainers if left in the code.

This rule raises an issue when a class is using <code>SafeHandle</code> and still contains calls to <code>GC.KeepAlive</code>.

Fields, parameters and return values marked <code>@NotNull</code>, <code>@NonNull</code>, or <code>@Nonnull</code> are assumed to have non-null values and are not typically null-checked before use. Therefore setting one of these values to <code>null</code>, or failing to set such a class field in a constructor, could cause <code>NullPointerException</code>s at runtime.

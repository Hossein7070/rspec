An <code>extends</code> or <code>implements</code> list entry is redundant if:

* It is <code>Object</code> - all classes extend <code>Object</code> implicitly.
* It is <code>int</code> for an <code>enum</code>
* It is listed multiple times.
* It is a superclass of another listed extension.

Such redundant declarations should be removed because they needlessly clutter the code and can be confusing.

DOM-XSS attacks also called https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html[type-0 XSS] are malicious scripts injected on the client side and not on the server side as in the case of _stored_ or _reflected_ cross-site script attacks. In this kind of attack, the entire tainted data flow from source (eg: <code>document.location.href</code>) to sink (eg: <code>document.write</code>) takes place in the browser, so these attacks do not leave many traces and for example cannot be detected once the web application is in production by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system[IDS] systems which inspect the response of the server.

DOM objects that can be influenced by users like <code>document.location.href</code> should always be considered untrusted and validated or sanitized before being used to modify the DOM.

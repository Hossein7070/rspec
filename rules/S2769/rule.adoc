Once you've made a selection, you typically want to know whether it actually found anything. Since selectors _always_ return an object (the set of selected DOM elements), the best way to see whether your selection found anything is to test the returned object's <code>.length</code> property. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
if ( $( "div.foo" ) ) {  // Noncompliant
  // this code always runs, even when the selector didn't match any elements
  // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
// Testing whether a selection contains elements.
if ( $( "div.foo" ).length > 0) {
  // this code only runs if elements were found
  //  ...
}
----

This rule allows the definition of custom rules using XPath expressions.

Issues are created depending on the return value of the XPath expression. If the XPath expression returns:

* a single or list of AST nodes, then a line issue with the given message is created for each node
* a boolean, then a file issue with the given message is created only if the boolean is true
* anything else, no issue is created

On the following code, the XPath expression <code>//IDENTIFIER[string-length(@tokenValue) >= 10]</code> generates a violation on the identifier "aaaaaaaaaa":

----
DECLARE
  aaaaaaaaaa NUMBER := 10; /* Non-Compliant, this identifier is 10 characters long */
  aaaaaaaaa NUMBER := 9; /* Compliant, this one is only 9 */
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/

<p>This rule allows the definition of custom rules using XPath expressions.</p>
<p>Issues are created depending on the return value of the XPath expression. If the XPath expression returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single or list of AST nodes, then a line issue with the given message is created for each node</li>
<li>a boolean, then a file issue with the given message is created only if the boolean is true</li>
<li>anything else, no issue is created</li>
</ul>
<p>On the following code, the XPath expression &lt;code&gt;//IDENTIFIER[string-length(@tokenValue) &gt;= 10]&lt;/code&gt; generates a violation on the identifier "aaaaaaaaaa":</p>
<pre>
DECLARE
  aaaaaaaaaa NUMBER := 10; /* Non-Compliant, this identifier is 10 characters long */
  aaaaaaaaa NUMBER := 9; /* Compliant, this one is only 9 */
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
</pre>

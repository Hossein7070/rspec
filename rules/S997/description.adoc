Declaring names in appropriate namespaces reduces the number of names found during lookup, decreasing the risk of name clash and of surprising name lookup. 

This rule raises an issue when a name in the global namespace has external linkage and therefore can be accessed from outside a particular translation unit.

Some names have to be declared in the global namespace, and are excluded from this rule:
* <code>main</code> (or its variants)
* Overloads of the global <code>new</code> & <code>delete</code> operators

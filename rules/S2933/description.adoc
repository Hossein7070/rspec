<code>readonly</code> fields can only be assigned in a class constructor. If a class has a field that's not marked <code>readonly</code> but is only set in the constructor, it could cause confusion about the field's intended use. To avoid confusion, such fields should be marked <code>readonly</code> to make their intended use explicit, and to prevent future maintainers from inadvertently changing their use.

Failure to control types during deserialization can lead to runtime errors and vulnerabilities. There are many types, called "gadgets" which are known to be dangerous when deserializing. All languages ​​are affected and the most in-depth studies have been carried out for:
* PHP: https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc[phpgcc] - _library of unserialize() payloads_.
*  Java: https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial[ysoserial] - _A tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization_.
* .NET: https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net[ysoserial.net] - _Deserialization payload generator for a variety of .NET formatters_.

During the deserialization process, the state of an object will be reconstructed from the serialized data stream which can contain dangerous operations.

For example, a well-known attack vector consists in serializing an object of type <code>https://javadoc.idrsolutions.com/org/jpedal/io/ObjectStore.html[org.jpedal.io.ObjectStore]</code> in Java, <code>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.codedom.compiler.tempfilecollection.-ctor?view=netframework-4.8#System_CodeDom_Compiler_TempFileCollection__ctor[TempFileCollection]</code> in C# and <code>https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_Http_Response_Stream.html[Zend_Http_Response_Stream]</code> in PHP, with arbitrary files defined by the attacker which will be deleted on the application deserializing this object (when the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.codedom.compiler.tempfilecollection.finalize?view=netframework-4.8[finalize() ]method of the TempFileCollection object, for instance, is called).

To restrict the types allowed to be deserialized:
* implement a whitelist of safe and required types that can be deserialized.
* or/and implement tamper protection, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[message authentication codes] (MAC), this way only objects serialized with the correct MAC hash will be deserialized.

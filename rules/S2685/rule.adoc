Both <code>arguments.caller</code> and <code>arguments.callee</code> make quite a few optimizations impossible so they were deprecated in latest versions of JavaScript. In fact, EcmaScript 5 forbids the use of both in <code>strict</code> mode, according to the docs:
bq. Arguments objects for strict mode functions define non-configurable accessor properties named "caller" and "callee" which throw a TypeError exception on access.

The same restriction applies to the function's <code>caller</code> and <code>arguments</code> properties in <code>strict</code> mode.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function whoCalled() {
   if (arguments.caller == null)   //Noncompliant
      console.log('I was called from the global scope.');
   else
      console.log(arguments.caller + ' called me!');  // Noncompliant

  console.log(whoCalled.caller);  // Noncompliant
  console.log(whoCalled.arguments);  // Noncompliant
}

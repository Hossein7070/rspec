<p>Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring error-prone, since you must be sure to update all occurrences.
On the other hand, constants can be referenced from many places, but only need to be updated in a single place.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>To prevent generating some false-positives, literals having less than 10 characters are excluded as well as literals matching &lt;code&gt;/^\w*$/&lt;/code&gt;. String literals inside import/export statements and JSX attributes are also ignored. The same goes for statement-like string literals, e.g. &lt;code&gt;'use strict';&lt;/code&gt;.</p>

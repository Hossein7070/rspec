== Exceptions

To prevent generating some false-positives, literals having less than 10 characters are excluded as well as literals matching <code>/^\w*$/</code>. String literals inside import/export statements and JSX attributes are also ignored. The same goes for statement-like string literals, e.g. <code>'use strict';</code>.

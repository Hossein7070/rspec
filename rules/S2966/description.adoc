The point of declaring an optional variable is to make explicit the fact that it might contain no valid value, i.e. <code>nil</code>. Force-unwrapping an optional will lead to a runtime error if the optional does contain <code>nil</code>. Even if the value is tested first, it's still considered a bad practice to use force-unwrapping. Instead, optional binding or optional chaining should be used.

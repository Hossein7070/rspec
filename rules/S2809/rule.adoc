Using "CALL TRANSACTION" statements without an authority check is security sensitive. Its access should be restricted to specific users.

This rule raises when a <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> has no explicit authorization check, i.e. when:

* the <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> statement is not followed by <code>WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK</code>.
* the <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> statement is not following an <code>AUTHORITY-CHECK</code> statement.
* the <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> statement is not following a call to the <code>AUTHORITY_CHECK_TCODE</code> function.


== Ask Yourself Whether

* the <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> statement is restricted to the right users.

There is a risk if you answered no to this question.


== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Check current user's authorization before every <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> statement. Since ABAP 7.4 this should be done by appending <code>WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK</code> to <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> statements. In earlier versions the <code>AUTHORITY-CHECK</code> statement or a call to the <code>AUTHORITY_CHECK_TCODE</code> function can be used.

Note that since ABAP 7.4 any <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> statement not followed by <code>WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK</code> or <code>WITHOUT AUTHORITY-CHECK</code> https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_751_index_htm/7.51/en-US/abapcall_transaction_authority.htm[is obsolete].


== Sensitive Code Example

----
CALL TRANSACTION 'MY_DIALOG'.  " Sensitive as there is no apparent authorization check. It is also obsolete since ABAP 7.4.
----


== Compliant Solution

----
AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'S_DIAGID'
                  ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '03'.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  " show an error message...
ENDIF.

CALL TRANSACTION 'MY_DIALOG'. " Ok but obsolete since ABAP 7.4.
----
or

----
CALL FUNCTION 'AUTHORITY_CHECK_TCODE'
  exporting
    tcode  = up_fdta
  exceptions
    ok     = 0
    others = 4.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  " show an error message...
ENDIF.

CALL TRANSACTION up_fdta USING up_bdc mode 'E'. " Ok but obsolete since ABAP 7.4.
----
or

----
CALL TRANSACTION 'MY_DIALOG' WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK. " Recommended way since ABAP 7.4.
----


== Exceptions

No issue will be raised when <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> is followed by <code>WITHOUT AUTHORITY-CHECK</code> as it explicitly says that the TRANSACTION does not require an authorization check.

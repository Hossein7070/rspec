This rule applies whenever an <code>if</code> statement is followed by one or more <code>else if</code> statements; the final <code>else if</code> should be followed by an <code>else</code> statement.

The requirement for a final <code>else</code> statement is defensive programming.
The <code>else</code> statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the requirement to have a final <code>default</code> clause in a <code>switch</code> statement.

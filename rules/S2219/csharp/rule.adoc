To check the type of an object there are several options:
* <code>expr is SomeType</code> or <code>expr.GetType() == typeof(SomeType)</code> if the type is known at compile time,
* <code>typeInstance.IsInstanceOfType(expr)</code> if the type is calculated during runtime.

If runtime calculated <code>Type</code>s need to be compared:
* <code>typeInstance1.IsAssignableFrom(typeInstance2)</code>.

Depending on whether the type is returned by a <code>GetType()</code> or <code>typeof()</code> call, the <code>IsAssignableFrom()</code> and <code>IsInstanceOfType()</code> might be simplified. Similarly, if the type is <code>sealed</code>, the type comparison with <code>==</code> can be converted to an <code>is</code> call. Simplifying the calls also make <code>null</code> checking unnecessary because both <code>is</code> and <code>IsInstanceOfType</code> performs it already.

Finally, utilizing the most concise language constructs for type checking makes the code more readable, so
* <code>expr as T != null</code> checks should be simplified to <code>expr is T</code>, and
* <code>expr is T</code> should be converted to <code>expr != null</code>, when <code>expr</code> is of type <code>T</code>.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
class Fruit { }
sealed class Apple : Fruit { }

class Program
{
  static void Main()
  {
    var apple = new Apple();
    var b = apple != null && apple.GetType() == typeof (Apple); // Noncompliant
    b = typeof(Apple).IsInstanceOfType(apple); // Noncompliant
    if (apple != null)
    {
      b = typeof(Apple).IsAssignableFrom(apple.GetType()); // Noncompliant
    }
    var appleType = typeof (Apple);
    if (apple != null)
    {
      b = appleType.IsAssignableFrom(apple.GetType()); // Noncompliant
    }

    Fruit f = apple;
    if (f as Apple != null) // Noncompliant
    {
    }
    if (apple is Apple) // Noncompliant
    {
    }
  }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
class Fruit { }
sealed class Apple : Fruit { }

class Program
{
  static void Main()
  {
    var apple = new Apple();
    var b = apple is Apple;
    b = apple is Apple;
    b = apple is Apple;
    var appleType = typeof(Apple);
    b = appleType.IsInstanceOfType(apple);

    Fruit f = apple;
    if (f is Apple)
    {
    }
    if (apple != null)
    {
    }
  }
}

== Exceptions

Calling <code>GetType</code> on an object of <code>Nullable<T></code> type returns the underlying generic type parameter <code>T</code>, thus a comparison with <code>typeof(Nullable<T>)</code> can't be simplified to use the <code>is</code> operator, which doesn't make difference between <code>T</code> and <code>T?</code>.
----
int? i = 42;
bool condition = i.GetType() == typeof(int?); // false;
condition = i is int?; // true
----
No issue is reported on the following expressions:
* <code>expr is T</code>Â when either operand of the <code>is</code> operator is a value type. In that case CS0183 or CS0184 reports
* <code>expr is object</code>, as this is a common and efficient pattern to do null checks

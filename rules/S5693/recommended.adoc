== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* For most of the features of an application, it is recommended to limit the size of requests to:
   ** lower or equal to 8mb for file uploads.
   ** lower or equal to 2mb for other requests.

It is recommended to customize the rule with the limit values that correspond to the web application.

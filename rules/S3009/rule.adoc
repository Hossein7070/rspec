It's slightly more efficient to append single characters to <code>StringBuffer</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> instances as <code>char</code>s, than as <code>String</code>s. That is, it's more efficient to put a single <code>char</code> in single quotes, rather than double quotes.


== Noncompliant Code Example.

----
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

sb.append("a"); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

sb.append('a'); // Noncompliant
----

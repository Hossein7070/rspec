There is little valid reason to use the methods of the <code>ThreadGroup</code> class. Some are deprecated (<code>allowThreadSuspension()</code>, <code>resume()</code>, <code>stop()</code>, and <code>suspend()</code>), some are obsolete, others aren't thread-safe, and still others are insecure (<code>activeCount()</code>, <code>enumerate()</code>) . For these reasons, any use of <code>ThreadGroup</code> is suspicious and should be avoided.


== Compliant Solution

----
ThreadFactory threadFactory = Executors.defaultThreadFactory();
ThreadPoolExecutor executorPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(3, 10, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable>(2), threadFactory);

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  executorPool.execute(new JobThread("Job: " + i));
}

System.out.println(executorPool.getActiveCount()); // Compliant
executorPool.shutdown();

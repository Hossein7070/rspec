When a function is called, it accepts only one value per parameter. Python interpreters will raise a SyntaxError when they see something like <code>myfunction(a=1, a=2)</code>, but there are other cases which will only fail at runtime:
* An argument is provided by value and position at the same time.
* Some arguments are provided via unpacking and the same argument is provided twice.

This rule raises an issue when a function is called with multiple values for the same parameter.

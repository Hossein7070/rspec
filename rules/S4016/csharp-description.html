<p>If an &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; member’s name contains the word "reserved" it implies it is not currently used and will be change in the future. However changing an &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; member is a breaking change and can create significant problems. There is no need to reserve an &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; member since a new member can be added in the future, and such an addition will usually not be a breaking change.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the name of an enumeration member contains "reserved".</p>

There are three distinct <code>char</code> types, (plain) <code>char</code>, <code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code>. <code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code> should only be used for numeric data, and plain <code>char</code> should only be used for character data. Since it is implementation-defined, the signedness of the plain <code>char</code> type should not be assumed.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
signed char a = 'a'; // Noncompliant, explicitly signed 
unsigned char b = '\r'; // Noncompliant, explicitly unsigned 
char c = 10; // Noncompliant

unsigned char d = c; // Noncompliant, d is explicitly signed while c is not
char e = a; // Noncompliant, a is explicitly signed while e is not
----


== Compliant Solution

----
char a = 'a';
char b = '\r';
unsigned char c = 10;
signed char c = 10;
----


== Exceptions

* Since the integer value 0 is used as a sentinel for the end of a string, converting this value to char is ignored.

"Time Of Check to Time Of Use" (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities occur when an application:
* First, checks permissions or attributes of a file: for instance, is a file a symbolic link?
* Next, performs some operations such as writing data to this file.

The application cannot assume the state of the file is unchanged between these two steps, there is a race condition (ie: two different processes can access and modify the same shared object/file at the same time, which can lead to privilege escalation, denial of service and other unexpected results).

For instance, an attacker can benefit from this situation by creating, just after the first step, a symbolic link to a sensitive file (eg in Unix: <code>/etc/password</code>) and try to elevate his privileges (eg: if the written data has the correct <code>/etc/password</code> file format).

Overriding a method just to call the same method from the super class without performing any other actions is useless and misleading. The only time this is justified is in <code>final</code> overriding methods, where the effect is to lock in the parent class behavior. This rule ignores such overrides of <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code> and <code>toString</code>.

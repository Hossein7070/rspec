Hidden files are created automatically by many tools to save user-preferences, well-known examples are <code>.profile</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.bash_history</code> or .<code>git</code>. To simplify the view these files are not displayed by default using operating system commands like <code>ls</code>.

Outside of the user environment, hidden files are sensitive because they are used to store privacy-related information or even hard-coded secrets.

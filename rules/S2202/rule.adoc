Specifying the parameters to a procedure with a <code>PLIST</code> makes that procedure unusable from free-format code. Instead, prototypes should be used - both when defining a procedure and when calling it. They have the additional benefit of allowing you to use keywords such as <code>Const</code> to better-specify how parameters are passed to a procedure. Further, the use of a prototype instead of a <code>PLIST</code> is cleaner and  more consistent with the code required for subprocedures. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
      * Noncompliant; PLIST specified
     C     *ENTRY        PLIST
     C                   PARM                    ZipCode           5 0
     C                   PARM                    City             20
...
      * Noncompliant; PLIST used in call
     C                   CALL      'OTHERPROG'
     C                   PARM                    ZipCode
     C                   PARM                    City

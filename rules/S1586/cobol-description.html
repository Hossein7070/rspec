<p>To prevent any unexpected behavior, data items must be initialized before being used by a &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; statement. A data item is considered to be initialized in the three following cases :</p>
<ul>
<li>One of its parents has been initialized</li>
<li>It has been defined in the &lt;code&gt;LINKAGE-SECTION&lt;/code&gt;</li>
<li>The &lt;code&gt;MOVE SPACE[S] TO …​&lt;/code&gt; and then the &lt;code&gt;INITIALIZE&lt;/code&gt; statements have been sequentially executed on this data item. Both statements are required in that order because the &lt;code&gt;INITIALIZE&lt;/code&gt; statement doesn’t initialize &lt;code&gt;FILLER&lt;/code&gt;s and non-named fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that activating this rule will impact the overall performance of the analysis.</p>

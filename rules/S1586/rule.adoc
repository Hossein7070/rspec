To prevent any unexpected behavior, data items must be initialized before being used by a <code>CALL</code> statement. A data item is considered to be initialized in the three following cases :

* One of its parents has been initialized
* It has been defined in the <code>LINKAGE-SECTION</code>
* The <code>MOVE SPACE[S] TO ...</code> and then the <code>INITIALIZE</code> statements have been sequentially executed on this data item. Both statements are required in that order because the <code>INITIALIZE</code> statement doesn't initialize <code>FILLER</code>s and non-named fields.

Be aware that activating this rule will impact the overall performance of the analysis.

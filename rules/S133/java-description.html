<p>The Cyclomatic Complexity of methods should not exceed a defined threshold. Complex code may perform poorly and can be difficult to test thoroughly.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>While having a large number of fields in a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; may indicate that it should be split, this rule nonetheless ignores high complexity in &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; methods.</p>

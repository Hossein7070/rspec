The catch-all handler should come last in a chain of <code>catch</code> or <code>@catch</code> statements because it catches everything, and any more-specific <code>catch</code>/<code>@catch</code> that comes after it will never be used, even when the relevant condition occurs. 

This C++ code sample is very similar to the Objective-C equivalent with <code>@try</code> and <code>@catch</code>.

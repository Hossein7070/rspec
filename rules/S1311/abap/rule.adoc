The Cyclomatic Complexity is measured by summing the number of <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> operators, the number of control flow statement like <code>IF</code>, <code>WHILE</code>, <code>DO</code>, <code>RETURN</code> ... in the body of a class plus one for each method. Even when the Cyclomatic Complexity of a class is very high, this complexity might be well distributed among all methods. Nevertheless, most of the time, a very complex class is a class which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle and which should be re-factored to be split in several classes.

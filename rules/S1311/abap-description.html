<p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is measured by summing the number of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; operators, the number of control flow statement like &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; …​ in the body of a class plus one for each method. Even when the Cyclomatic Complexity of a class is very high, this complexity might be well distributed among all methods. Nevertheless, most of the time, a very complex class is a class which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle and which should be re-factored to be split in several classes.</p>

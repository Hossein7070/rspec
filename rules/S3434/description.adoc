Shadowing parent class members by creating properties and methods with the same signatures as non-<code>virtual</code> parent class members can result in seemingly strange behavior if an instance of the child class is cast to the parent class. In such cases, the parent class' code will be executed instead of the code in the child class, confusing callers and potentially causing hard-to-find bugs.

Instead the child class member should be renamed.

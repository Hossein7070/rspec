Unstructured programming has been strongly criticized for producing barely readable (spaghetti) code. It offers programmers great freedom, but is considered a bad approach for creating major projects.

In COBOL, the use of <code>GO TO</code> statements can lead to unstructured control flows. Eliminating <code>GO TO</code> statements in favor of <code>PERFORM</code> statements will aid adherence to a procedural programming approach. However, this change could require heavy refactoring.

<p>Unstructured programming has been strongly criticized for producing barely readable (spaghetti) code. It offers programmers great freedom, but is considered a bad approach for creating major projects.</p>
<p>In COBOL, the use of &lt;code&gt;GO TO&lt;/code&gt; statements can lead to unstructured control flows. Eliminating &lt;code&gt;GO TO&lt;/code&gt; statements in favor of &lt;code&gt;PERFORM&lt;/code&gt; statements will aid adherence to a procedural programming approach. However, this change could require heavy refactoring.</p>

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

 * If the signal is sent because of a user's request. Check that the user is allowed to send this signal. You can for example forbid it if the user doesn't own the process.
 * Secure the source from which the process PID is read.
 * Run the process sending the signals with minimal permissions.

<p>Variables that are never updated will always return their default values and so they should be explicitly declared as constant. A &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;-declaration guarantees and clearly signals to the programmer that its value is supposed to and will never change.
This rule applies to non-constant fields and variables which are not set within the codebase.</p>

<p>At root,  &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;require_once&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;include_once&lt;/code&gt; all perform the same task of including one file in another. However, the way they perform that task differs, and they should not be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>&lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; includes a file but generates a fatal error if an error occurs in the process.</p>
<p>&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; also includes a file, but generates only a warning if an error occurs.</p>
<p>Predictably, the difference between &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;require_once&lt;/code&gt; is the same as the difference between &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;include_once&lt;/code&gt; - the "_once" versions ensure that the specified file is only included once.</p>
<p>Because including the same file multiple times could have unpredictable results, the "once" versions are preferred.</p>
<p>Because &lt;code&gt;include_once&lt;/code&gt; generates only warnings, it should be used only when the file is being included conditionally, i.e. when all possible error conditions have been checked beforehand.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
include 'code.php';  //Noncompliant; not a "_once" usage and not conditional
include $user.'_history.php'; // Noncompliant
require 'more_code.php';  // Noncompliant; not a "_once" usage
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
require_once 'code.php';
if (is_member($user)) {
  include_once $user.'_history.php';
}
require_once 'more_code.php';
</pre>

<p>If a program throws an unhandled exception it terminates in an implementation-defined manner. In particular, it is implementation-defined whether the call stack is unwound before termination, so the destructors of any automatic objects may or may not be executed. By enforcing the provision of a “last-ditch catch-all”, the developer can ensure that the program terminates in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>The possible exceptions from a program should be caught as a matter of course. This rule’s objective is to ensure that exceptions that were <em>not</em> expected are also caught.</p>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>For the majority of programs this will mean &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; should look like:</p>
<pre>
int32_t main( )
{
  try
  {
    // program code
  }
  catch ( ... ) // Catch-all handler
  {
    // Handle unexpected exceptions
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>

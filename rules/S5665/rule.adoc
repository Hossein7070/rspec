The use of escape sequences is mostly unnecessary in text blocks.


== Noncompliant Code Example

<code>\n</code> can be replaced by simply introducing the newline, <code>\"\"\"</code> it is sufficient to escape only the first qoute.

----
String textBlock = """
        \"\"\" this \nis
        text  block!
        !!!!
      """;
----


== Compliant Solution

----
String textBlock = """
        \""" this 
        is
        text  block!
        !!!!
      """;
----

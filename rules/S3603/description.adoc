Marking a method with the <code>Pure</code> attribute specifies that the method doesn't make any visible changes; thus, the method should return a result, otherwise the call to the method should be equal to no-operation. So <code>Pure</code> on a <code>void</code> method is either a mistake, or the method doesn't do any meaningful task.

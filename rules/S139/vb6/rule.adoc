== Noncompliant Code Example

With the default value for the <code>legalTrailingCommentPattern</code> parameter: <code>^'\s*[^\s]+$</code>

----
a = b + c   ' This is a trailing comment that could be very very long  -- Noncompliant
d = a + 9 REM This is another trailing comment which could be very very long  -- Noncompliant
e = a * b ' FIXME  -- allowed
----

== Compliant Solution

----
' This very long comment is better placed before the line of code
a = b + c
REM This is very long comment which is better placed before the line of code
d = a + 9
e = a * b ' FIXME

<p>By convention, a Java class' physical location (source directories) and its logical representation (packages) should be kept in sync. Thus a Java file located at &lt;code&gt;"src/org/bar/Foo.java"&lt;/code&gt; should have a package of &lt;code&gt;"org.bar"&lt;/code&gt;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this convention is not enforced by Java compilers, and nothing prevents a developer from making the "Foo.java" class part of the "com.apple" package, which could degrade the maintainability of both the class and its application.</p>
<p>Similarly, source placed in a folder with dots in its name instead of having the equivalent folder structure will compile but cause problems at run time. For instance, code with a package declaration of &lt;code&gt;org.foo.bar&lt;/code&gt; that is placed in &lt;code&gt;org/foo.bar&lt;/code&gt; will compile, but the classloader will always search for the class into the folder based on package structure, and will consequently expect sources to be in &lt;code&gt;org/foo/bar&lt;/code&gt; folder. &lt;code&gt;foo.bar&lt;/code&gt; is therefore not a proper folder name for sources.</p>

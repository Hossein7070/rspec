Regular expressions are powerful but tricky, and even those long used to using them can make mistakes.

The following should not be used as regular expressions:
* <code>.</code> - matches any single character. Used in <code>replaceAll</code>, it matches _everything_
* <code>|</code> - normally used as an option delimiter. Used stand-alone, it matches the space between characters
* <code>File.separator</code> - matches the platform-specific file path delimiter. On Windows, this will be taken as an escape character
* <code>[]</code> - empty character class doesn't match anything

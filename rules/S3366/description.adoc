In single-threaded environments, the use of <code>this</code> in constructors is normal, and expected. But in multi-threaded environments, it could expose partially-constructed objects to other threads, and should be used with caution.

The classic example is a class with a <code>static</code> list of its instances. If the constructor stores <code>this</code> in the list, another thread could access the object before it's fully-formed. Even when the storage of <code>this</code> is the last instruction in the constructor, there's still a danger if the class is not <code>final</code>. In that case, the initialization of subclasses won't be complete before <code>this</code> is exposed.

This rule raises an issue when <code>this</code> is assigned to any globally-visible object in a constructor, and when it is passed to the method of another object in a constructor

A <code>WHERE</code> clause condition that uses <code>NOT IN</code> with a subquery will have unexpected results if that subquery returns <code>NULL</code>. On the other hand,Â <code>NOT EXISTS</code> subqueries work reliably under the same conditions.

This rule raises an issue when <code>NOT IN</code> is used with a subquery. This rule doesn't check if the selected column is a nullable column because the rules engine has no information about the table definition. It's up to the developer to review manually if the column is nullable.

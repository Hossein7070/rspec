The standard assertions library methods such as <code>AreEqual</code> and <code>AreSame</code> in *MSTest* and *NUnit*, or <code>Equal</code> and <code>Same</code> in *XUnit*, expect the first argument to be the expected value and the second argument to be the actual value. Swap them, and your test will still have the same outcome (succeed/fail when it should) but the error messages will be confusing.

This rule raises an issue when the second argument to an assertions library method is a hard-coded value and the first argument is not.

Flags enumerations should not rely on the language to initialize the values of their members. Implicit initialization will set the first member to 0, and increment the value by one for each subsequent member. This implicit behavior does not allow members to be combined using the bitwise or operator in a useful way.

Instead, 0 and powers of two (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...) should be used to explicitly initialize all the members.

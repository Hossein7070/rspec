<p>A structure, such as a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain, and having a lot of fields is an indication that a structure has grown too large.</p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the structure into smaller ones that focus on well defined topics.</p>

<code>NaN</code> is not equal to anything, even itself. Testing for equality or inequality against <code>NaN</code> will yield predictable results, but probably not the ones you want. 

Instead, the best way to see whether a variable is equal to <code>NaN</code> is to use <code>Number.isNaN()</code>, since ES2015, or (perhaps counter-intuitively) to compare it to itself. Since <code>NaN !== NaN</code>, when <code>a !== a</code>, you know it must equal <code>NaN</code>.

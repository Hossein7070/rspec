Mutable objects are those whose state can be changed. For instance, an array is mutable, but a String is not. Mutable class members should never be returned to a caller or accepted and stored directly. Doing so leaves you vulnerable to unexpected changes in your class state.

Instead use an unmodifiable <code>Collection</code> (via <code>Collections.unmodifiableCollection</code>, <code>Collections.unmodifiableList</code>, ...) or make a copy of the mutable object, and store or return the copy instead.

This rule checks that arrays, collections and Dates are not stored or returned directly.

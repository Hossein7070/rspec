Marking a class with <code>PartCreationPolicy(CreationPolicy.Shared)</code>, which is part of Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), means that a single, shared instance of the exported object will be created. Therefore it doesn't make sense to create new instances using the constructor and it will most likely result in unexpected behaviours.

This rule raises an issue when a constructor of a class marked shared with a <code>PartCreationPolicyAttribute</code> is invoked.

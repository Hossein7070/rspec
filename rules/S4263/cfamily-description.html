<p>Microsoftâ€™s MSVC has a search strategy which differs from other compilers when resolving quoted include directives &lt;code&gt;#include "file.h"&lt;/code&gt;. Relying on such a strategy is not portable and may lead to compilation failure when trying to build with a different compiler.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue whenever the file specified in a &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; directive can only be found using the MSVC search strategy.</p>

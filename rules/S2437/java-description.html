<p>Certain bit operations are just silly and should not be performed because their results are predictable.</p>
<p>Specifically, using &lt;code&gt;&amp; -1&lt;/code&gt; with any value will always result in the original value, as will &lt;code&gt;anyValue ^ 0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;anyValue | 0&lt;/code&gt;.</p>

An XSD that grows too much  tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain, and having a lot of elements (<code>xs:schema</code>, <code>xs:import</code>, <code>xs:element</code>, <code>xs:simpleType</code>, <code>xs:complexType</code>, <code>xs:sequence</code>, <code>xs:choice</code>, <code>xs:all</code>, <code>xs:extension</code>, <code>xs:attribute</code>, <code>xs:enumeration</code>, <code>xs:complexContent</code>, <code>xs:group</code>) is an indication that an XSD has grown too large.

Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the XSD into smaller ones which focus on well defined topics.

<code>void*</code> is a pointer to memory of unknown type, and therefore works outside of the safety net provided by the type system. While it can be useful in a function body to interface with external code, there is no good reason to step out of the robust C++ type system when defining a function, either for the function parameters, or for the function return type.

If you want to work with raw memory buffer, use <code>unsigned char *</code> (or <code>byte *</code> if your compiler supports it).

If you want to work with different types of data, define a function template and use typed pointers, instead of <code>void *</code>.

If you want to provide to users of an API an opaque type, declare a type and don't provide its definition (like with <code>FILE*</code>).


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void saveBuffer(void *buffer, size_t size); // Noncompliant
void duplicate(void* destination, size_t count, void *source, size_t size); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void saveBuffer(unsigned char *buffer, size_t size);
template<class T>
void duplicate(T* destination, size_t count, T *source);
----

Except for interactions with <code>extern volatile</code> variables provided by libraries, C/C++ programmers should consider <code>volatile</code> an esoteric feature that is best avoided. In most cases, it is used in an attempt to provide atomicity, memory ordering, or inter-thread synchronization, but <code>volatile</code> does not provide those guarantees. It is only really needed for the kind of low-level code found in kernels or embedded software, i.e. using memory-mapped I/O registers to manipulate hardware directly. 

According to the C standard:

<code>volatile</code> is a hint to the implementation to avoid aggressive optimization involving the object because the value of the object might be changed by means undetectable by an implementation.

Only C11/C++11 "atomic types" are free from data races.

This rule raises an issue when a <code>volatile</code> type is declared.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
volatile int counter; // Noncompliant
User * volatile vpUser; // Noncompliant; pointer is volatile 
User volatile * pvUser;  // Compliant; User instance is volatile, not the pointer
----


== Compliant Solution

----
atomic_int counter;
std::atomic<User*> vpUser;
User volatile * pvUser;
----

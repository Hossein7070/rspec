Pluggable authentication module (PAM) is a mechanism used on many unix variants to provide a unified way to authenticate users, independently of the underlying authentication scheme.

When authenticating users, it is strongly recommended to check the validity of the account (not locked, not expired ...), otherwise it leads to unauthorized access to resources.

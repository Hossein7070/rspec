<p>Using the output of a non-boolean assignment as a condition is highly suspicious. Either it was done accidentally, and the assignment operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; was used in place of the equality operator &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, or it was done with the intent to rely on the automatic conversion of the non-boolean value to a boolean, which could be confusing for maintainers.</p>

<p>PL/I, unlike many other programming languages, does not reserve any word’s usage.
This implies that it is syntaxically valid to use the keyword &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; as variable names for instance.
But doing so results in confusing code which is hard to read, especially in editors without proper PL/I syntax highlighting support.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
foo: proc options(main);
  declare if fixed decimal init (42); /* Non-Compliant */

  if if = 42 then do; /* Cconfusing */
    put list ('if = 42');
  end;

  go to goto; /* Confusing */

  goto: /* Non-Compliant */
  ;
end;
</pre>

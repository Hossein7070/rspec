<p>&lt;code&gt;@Stateful&lt;/code&gt; EJB’s are designed to maintain user state through a multi-step process. When that process is over, you must be sure to call the bean’s &lt;code&gt;@Remove&lt;/code&gt; method to remove the bean from the container. Otherwise, bean instances will hang around in memory until their sessions time out, potentially causing resource problems.</p>

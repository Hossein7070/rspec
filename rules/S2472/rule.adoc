Oracle supports at most 1000 items in a SQL query's <code>IN</code> clause. When more items are given, the exception <code>ORA-01795 maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000</code> is raised. Thus, <code>IN</code> clauses are not as scalable as joins.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
BEGIN
  SELECT *
  INTO result
  FROM my_table
  WHERE col1 IN (1, 2, 3, ..., 1001);       -- Noncompliant - raises ORA-01795
END;
/
----


== Compliant Solution

----
BEGIN
  SELECT my_table.*
  INTO result
  FROM my_table
  JOIN new_in_table
  WHERE my_table.col1 = new_in_table.value; -- Compliant
END;
/
----

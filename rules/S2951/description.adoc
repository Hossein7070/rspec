Because <code>case</code> statements in a Swift <code>switch</code> do not fall through, there is no need to use <code>break</code> at the end of a <code>case</code> unless it would otherwise be empty. Since an empty <code>case</code> isn't allowed, an explicit <code>break</code> is needed to make such code compilable. There is no other reason to use <code>break</code> in a <code>case</code>.

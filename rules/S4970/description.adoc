The <code>catch</code> block of a checked exception "E" may be hidden because the corresponding <code>try</code> block only throws exceptions derived from E.
These derived exceptions are handled in dedicated <code>catch</code> blocks prior to the <code>catch</code> block of the base exception E. 

The <code>catch</code> block of E is unreachable and should be considered dead code. It should be removed, or the entire try-catch structure should be refactored.

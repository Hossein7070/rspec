If a type is declared but not used, then it is unclear to a reviewer if the type is redundant or it has been left unused by mistake.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void unusedtype()
{
  typedef int local_Type; // Noncompliant, unused
}

== See

* MISRA C++:2008, 0-1-5 - A project shall not contain unused type declarations.

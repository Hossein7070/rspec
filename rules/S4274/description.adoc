An <code>assert</code> is inappropriate for parameter validation because assertions can be disabled at runtime in the JVM, meaning that a bad operational setting would completely eliminate the intended checks. Further, <code>assert</code>s that fail throw <code>AssertionError</code>s, rather than throwing some type of <code>Exception</code>. Throwing <code>Error</code>s is completely outside of the normal realm of expected <code>catch</code>/<code>throw</code> behavior in normal programs.

This rule raises an issue when a <code>public</code> method uses one or more of its parameters with <code>assert</code>s.

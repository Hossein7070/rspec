Unconstrained use of <code>goto</code> can lead to programs that are extremely difficult to comprehend and analyse. For C++, it can also lead to the program exhibiting unspecified behavior.

However, in many cases a total ban on <code>goto</code> requires the introduction of flags to ensure correct control flow, and it is possible that these flags may themselves be less transparent than the <code>goto</code> they replace.

Therefore, the restricted use of <code>goto</code> is allowed where that use will not lead to semantics contrary to developer expectations. "Back" jumps are prohibited, since they can be used to create iterations without using the well-defined iteration statements supplied by the core language.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Validate the full path of the extracted file against the full path of the directory where files are expanded:

* the canonical path of the expanded file must start with the canonical path of the directory where files are extracted.
* the name of the archive entry must not contain "..", i.e. reference to a parent directory.

Stop extracting the archive if any of its entries has been tainted with a directory traversal path.

Define and control the ratio between compressed and uncompress bytes.

Define and control the maximum allowed expanded file size.

Count the number of file entries extracted from the archive and abort the extraction if their number is greater than a predefined threshold.

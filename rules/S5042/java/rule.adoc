== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Validate the full path of the extracted file against the full path of the directory where files are uncompressed.
** the canonical path of the uncompressed file must start with the canonical path of the directory where files are extracted.
** the name of the archive entry must not contain "..", i.e. reference to a parent directory.

----
String canonicalDirPath = outputDir.getCanonicalPath();
String canonicalDestPath = targetFile.getCanonicalPath();

if (!canonicalDestPath.startsWith(canonicalDirPath + File.separator)) { // Sanitizer
  throw new ArchiverException("Entry is trying to leave the target dir: " + zipEntry.getName());
}
----

* Stop extracting the archive if any of its entries has been tainted with a directory traversal path.

* Define and control the ratio between compressed and uncompress bytes.

* Define and control the maximum allowed uncompressed file size.

* Count the number of file entries extracted from the archive and abort the extraction if their number is greater than a predefined threshold.

== Sensitive Code Example

----
java.util.zip.ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(zipFileName);

Enumeration<? extends ZipEntry> entries = zipFile.entries(); 
while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
  ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement(); // Sensitive
  File f = new File(outputDir, e.getName());
  InputStream input = zipFile.getInputStream(e);
  extractFile(new ZipInputStream(input), outputDir, e.getName());
}
----

== Exceptions

This rule doesn't raise an issue when a ZipEntry or a ArchiveEntry:
* is declared as a class field
* is a parameter of an abstract method of an <code>interface</code> or <code>abstract</code> class

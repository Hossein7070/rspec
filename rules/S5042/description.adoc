Expanding archive files is security-sensitive. For example, expanding archive files has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1263[CVE-2018-1263]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16131[CVE-2018-16131]

Applications that expand archive files (zip, tar, jar, war, 7z, ...) should verify the path where the archive's files are expanded and not trust blindly the content of the archive. Archive's files should not be expanded outside of the root directory where the archive is supposed to be expanded. Also, applications should control the size of the expanded data to not be a victim of Zip Bomb attack. Failure to do so could allow an attacker to use a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal paths (e.g. ../../attacker.sh) or the attacker could overload the file system, processors or memory of the operating system where the archive is expanded making the target OS completely unusable.

This rule raises an issue when code handle archives. The goal is to guide security code reviews.

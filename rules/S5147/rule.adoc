User provided data such as URL parameters, POST data payloads or cookies should always be considered untrusted and tainted. Applications performing NoSQL operations based on tainted data could be exploited in a way similar to SQL Injection, where an attacker could inject database commands to access sensitive information or compromise data integrity.

The problem could be mitigated by sanitizing the user provided data, preferably based on a whitelist of allowed characters.

Delivering code in production with debug features activated is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1999007[CVE-2018-1999007]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5306[CVE-2015-5306]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2006[CVE-2013-2006]

An application's debug features enable developers to find bugs more easily and thus facilitate also the work of attackers. It often gives access to detailed information on both the system running the application and users.

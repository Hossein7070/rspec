<p>The &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM-ID&lt;/code&gt; declaration at the top of a program must exactly match the filename of the program. If these do not match, functions like &lt;code&gt;CANCEL&lt;/code&gt; may not be able to cancel the program, leaving it resident in memory. Debugging can also be affected because program breakpoints may not match the program name.</p>

<code>Throwable</code> is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in Java. <code>Error</code> is the superclass of all errors, which are not meant to be caught by applications.

Catching either <code>Throwable</code> or <code>Error</code> will also catch <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> and <code>InternalError</code>, from which an application should not attempt to recover.

Even though closing an open file isn't always mandatory (for instance when stopping the execution of a COBOL program with the <code>STOP RUN</code> statement), it's good coding practice to always explicitly close any open files. This rule checks that for every <code>OPEN</code> statement there is a corresponding <code>CLOSE</code> statement somewhere in the program.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
OPEN INPUT my-file

== Compliant Solution

...

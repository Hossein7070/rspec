Comparisons of dissimilar types will always return false. The comparison and all its dependent code can simply be removed. This includes:
* comparing an object with null
* comparing an object with an unrelated primitive (E.G. a string with an int)
* comparing unrelated classes
* comparing an unrelated <code>class</code> and <code>interface</code>
* comparing unrelated <code>interface</code> types

Extra semicolons (<code>;</code>) are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:
* It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten.
* There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>.
* There was a misunderstanding about where semicolons are required or useful.

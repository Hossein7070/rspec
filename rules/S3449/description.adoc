Numbers can be shifted with the <code><<</code> and <code>>></code> operators, but the right operand of the operation needs to be an <code>int</code> or a type that has an implicit conversion to <code>int</code>. However, with <code>dynamic</code>, the compiler's type checking is turned off, so you can pass anything to a shift operator and have it compile. And if  the argument can't be converted to <code>int</code> at runtime, then a <code>RuntimeBinderException</code> will be raised.

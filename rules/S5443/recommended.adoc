== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* Use a dedicated sub-folder with tightly controlled permissions
* Use secure-by-design APIs to create temporary files. Such API will make sure:
** The generated filename is unpredictable 
** The file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID
** The file descriptor is not inherited by child processes
** The file will be destroyed as soon as it is closed

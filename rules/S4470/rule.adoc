It is well documented that while <code>HttpClient</code> implements <code>IDisposable</code>, it is intended to be reused, which means not wrapping it in a <code>using</code> statement.

As noted in the documentation:
{quote}
HttpClient is intended to be instantiated once and re-used throughout the life of an application. Instantiating an HttpClient class for every request will exhaust the number of sockets available under heavy loads. This will result in SocketException errors.

This rule raises an issue when an instance of a <code>HttpClient</code> is created within a <code>using</code> statement.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
namespace MyLibrary
{
    public class Foo
    {
        public async Task Bar()
        {
            using (var client = new HttpClient()) // Noncompliant
            {
                await client.GetAsync("https://www.sonarqube.org/");
            }
        }
    }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
namespace MyLibrary
{
    public class Foo
    {
        private static HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

        public async Task Bar()
        {
            await client.GetAsync("https://www.sonarqube.org/");
        }
    }
}

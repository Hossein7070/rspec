There is a contract between <code>Equals(object)</code> and <code>GetHashCode()</code>: If two objects are equal according to the <code>Equals(object)</code> method, then calling <code>GetHashCode()</code> on each of them must yield the same result. If this is not the case, many collections won't handle class instances correctly.

In order to comply with the contract, <code>Equals(object)</code> and <code>GetHashCode()</code> should be either both inherited, or both overridden.

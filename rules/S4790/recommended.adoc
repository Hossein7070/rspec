== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Safer alternatives, such as <code>SHA-256</code>, <code>SHA-512</code>, <code>SHA-3</code> or <code>bcrypt</code> are recommended, and for password hashing, it's even better to use algorithms that not compute too "quickly", like <code>bcrypt</code> instead of <code>SHA-256</code>, because it slows brute force and dictionary based attacks.

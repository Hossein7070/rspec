The purpose of the <code>Thread.run()</code> method is to execute code in a separate, dedicated thread. Calling this method directly doesn't make sense because it causes its code to be executed in the current thread. 

To get the expected behavior, call the <code>Thread.start()</code> method instead.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
Thread myThread = new Thread(runnable);
myThread.run(); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
Thread myThread = new Thread(runnable);
myThread.start(); // Compliant
----

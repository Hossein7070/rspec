<p>Inappropriate casts are errors that will lead to bugs as the members are accessed. This includes casts from one unrelated type to another, as well as untested casts down an inheritance hierarchy.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
uint8_t  * p1;
uint32_t * p2;
p2 = (uint32_t *)p1; // Noncompliant: Alignments may differ

struct foo {
  int i;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct foo* bar = (struct foo *)main; // Noncompliant
  bar-&gt;i = 2;
  return bar-&gt;i;
}
</pre>

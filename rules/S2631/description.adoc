Regular expressions can have an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Implementations_and_running_times[exponential execution time] depending on the pattern and the length of the input string. The example below, for instance,  can lead to a denial of service of the application:
* Pattern: <code>/(a+)+b/</code>
* Input string: <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacb</code>

It is recommended:
* to fix the hard-coded regex patterns that use CPU intensive features (avoid if possible captures, nested quantifiers and back-references, for instance replace the above pattern with (/a+b/)).
* when the regex pattern is defined with an user-controlled input, this last should be sanitized in order to escape characters which are part of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Syntax[regular expression syntax].

Having two <code>WHEN</code> in a <code>CASE</code> statement or two branches in an <code>IF</code> chain  with the same implementation is at best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error. If the same logic is truly needed for both cases, they should be combined. 

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
CASE i.
  WHEN 1.
    doFirst.
    doSomething.
  WHEN 2.
    doSomethingDifferent.
  WHEN 3.  // Noncompliant; duplicates case 1's implementation
    doFirst.
    doSomething. 
  WHEN OTHERS. 
    doTheRest.
ENDCASE.

IF a >= 0 AND a < 10.
  doFirst.
  doTheThing.
ELSEIF a >= 10 AND a < 20.
  doTheOtherThing.
ELSEIF a >= 20 AND a < 50.
  doFirst.       // Noncompliant; duplicates first condition
  doTheThing.
ENDIF.
----

== Exceptions

Blocks in an <code>IF</code> chain or in <code>CASE</code> statement that contain a single line of code are ignored.

----
IF a >= 0 AND a < 10.
  doTheThing.
ELSEIF a >= 10 AND a < 20.
  doTheOtherThing.
ELSEIF a >= 20 AND a < 50.
  doTheThing.  // no issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
ENDIF.
----

But this exception does not apply to <code>IF</code> chains without final <code>ELSE</code>-s, or to <code>CASE</code>-s without <code>WHEN OTHERS</code> clauses when all branches have the same single line of code. In case of <code>IF</code> chains with <code>ELSE</code>-s, or of <code>CASE</code>-s with <code>WHEN OTHERS</code> clauses, rule S3923 raises a bug. 

----
if a >= 0 AND a < 10. //Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
  doTheThing.
elseif a >= 10 AND a < 20.
  doTheThing.
endif.

== Exceptions

Blocks in an <code>if</code> chain that contain a single line of code are ignored, as are blocks in a <code>switch</code> statement that contain a single line of code with or without a following <code>break</code>.

----
if (a == 1) {
  doSomething();  //no issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
} else if (a == 2) {
  doSomethingElse();
} else {
  doSomething();
}
----

But this exception does not apply to <code>if</code> chains without <code>else</code>-s, or to <code>switch</code>-es without default clauses when all branches have the same single line of code. In case of <code>if</code> chains with <code>else</code>-s, or of <code>switch</code>-es with default clauses, rule S3923 raises a bug. 

----
if (a == 1) {
  doSomething();  //Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
} else if (a == 2) {
  doSomething();
}

<p>An unused section is never called explicitly with help of the GO TO or PERFORM statements.
There can be only two reasons for having such a section:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is really unused and should be removed</li>
<li>It is only used as a kind of comment to clearly delimit a block of code, which is a bad practice</li>
</ul>
<p>The remediation action should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace the section by a comment line</li>
<li>Refactor the code to make an explicit call to this section instead of letting the execution flow going through it implicitly</li>
</ul>

== Exceptions

This rule ignores initializations to -1, 0, 1, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, [], \{\}, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>""</code>. Variables that start with an underscore (e.g. '<code>_unused</code>') are ignored.

This rule also ignores variables declared with object destructuring using rest syntax (used to exclude some properties from object):

----
let {a, b, ...rest} = obj; // 'a' and 'b' are ok
doSomething(rest);

let [x1, x2, x3] = arr;    // but 'x1' is noncompliant, as omitting syntax can be used: "let [, x2, x3] = arr;"
doSomething(x2, x3);
----

Applications that execute code dynamically should neutralize any externally-provided values used to construct the code. Failure to do so could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This could enable a wide range of serious attacks like accessing/modifying sensitive information or gain full system access.

The mitigation strategy should be based on whitelisting of allowed values or casting to safe types.

== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

To avoid <code>catastrophic backtracking</code> situations, when possible:

* The maximum number of expected repetitions should be defined with the corresponding quantifier, like <code>\{1,5\}</code> instead of <code>+</code> for instance.
* Refactor <code>nested quantifiers</code> to limit the number of way the inner group can be matched by the outer quantifier, for instance this nested quantifier situation <code>(ba+)+</code> doesn't cause performance issues, indeed, the inner group can be matched only if it exists exactly one <code>b</code> char per repetition of the group.
* Optimize regular expressions with <code>possessive quantifiers</code> and <code>atomic grouping</code>.

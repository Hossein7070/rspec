Creating an extension method that extends <code>object</code> is not recommended because it makes the method available on _every_ type. Extensions should be applied at the most specialized level possible, and that is very unlikely to be <code>object</code>.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
    public static class MyExtensions
    {
        public static void Foo(this object o)  //Noncompliant
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
}

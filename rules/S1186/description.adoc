There are several reasons for a method not to have a method body:

* It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed to prevent an unexpected behavior in production.
* It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case an exception should be thrown.
* The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.

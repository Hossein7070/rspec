<code>if</code> statements with conditions that are always false have the effect of making blocks of code non-functional. <code>if</code> statements with conditions that are always true are completely redundant, and make the code less readable.

There are three possible causes for the presence of such code: 

* An if statement was changed during debugging and that debug code has been committed.
* Some value was left unset.
* Some logic is not doing what the programmer thought it did.

In any of these cases, unconditional <code>if</code> statements should be removed.

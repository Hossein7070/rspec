Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all enumeration value names match a provided regular expression.

The default configuration is the one recommended by Microsoft:

* Pascal casing, starting with an upper case character, e.g. BackColor
* Short abbreviations of 2 letters can be capitalized, e.g. GetID
* Longer abbreviations need to be lower cased, e.g. GetHtml

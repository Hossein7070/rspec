Code is clearest when each statement has its own line. Nonetheless, it is a common pattern to combine on the same line an <code>if</code> and its resulting _then_ statement. However, when an <code>if</code> is placed on the same line as the closing <code>}</code> from a preceding  _then_, _else_ or _else if_ part, it is either an error - <code>else</code> is missing - or the invitation to a future error as maintainers fail to understand that the two statements are unconnected.

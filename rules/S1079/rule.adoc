The <code>%s</code> placeholder is used to read a word into a string.
By default, there is no restriction on the length of that word, and the developer is required to pass a sufficiently large buffer for storing it.
No matter how large the buffer is, there will always be a longer word.
Therefore, programs relying on <code>%s</code> are vulnerable to buffer overflows.

A field width specifier can be used together with the <code>%s</code> placeholder to limit the number of bytes which will by written to the buffer.
Note that an additional byte is required to store the null terminator.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%s", buffer);      // Noncompliant - will overflow when a word longer than 9 characters is entered
----


== Compliant Solution

----
char buffer[10];
scanf("%9s", buffer);     // Compliant - will not overflow
----

Validation is the first line of defense against injection, cross-site scripting, and many other attacks. Omitting it in modern web applications is simply negligent.

When creating a Struts <code>ActionForm</code>, you have the choice of extending something from the <code>org.apache.struts.action</code> package, or extending something from the <code>org.apache.struts.validator</code> package. Since you can't use the Struts validator capabilities without extending something from the <code>validator</code> package, that should always be your choice. 


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyForm extends org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm {  // Noncompliant
  // ...
----


== Compliant Solution

----
public class MyForm extends org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorForm {
  // ...
----

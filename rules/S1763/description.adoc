Some statements (<code>return</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>goto</code>, <code>switch</code>) and <code>throw</code> expressions move control flow out of the current code block. So any unlabeled statements that come after such a jump are unreachable, and either this dead code should be removed, or the logic should be corrected.

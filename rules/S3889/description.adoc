<code>Thread.Suspend</code> and <code>Thread.Resume</code> can give unpredictable results, and both methods have been deprecated. Indeed, if <code>Thread.Suspend</code> is not used very carefully, a thread can be suspended while holding a lock, thus leading to a deadlock. Other safer synchronization mechanisms should be used, such as <code>Monitor</code>, <code>Mutex</code>, and <code>Semaphore</code>.

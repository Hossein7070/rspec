https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit[<code>SystemExit</code>]Â is raised when https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit[<code>sys.exit()</code>] is called. This exception is expected to propagate up until the application stops. It is ok to catch it when a clean-up is necessary but it should be raised again immediately.

A https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement[bare <code>except:</code> statement], i.e. an <code>except</code> without any exception class, is equivalent to https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException[<code>except BaseException</code>]. Both statements will catch every exception, including <code>SystemExit</code>. It is recommended to catch instead a specific exception. If it is not possible, the exception should be raised again.

Note that it is also a good idea to reraise the https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt[<code>KeyboardInterrupt</code>] exception.

This rule raises an issue when a bare <code>except:</code>, an <code>except BaseException</code> or an <code>except SystemExit</code> don't reraise the exception caught.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
try:
    open("foo.txt", "r")
except SystemExit:  # Noncompliant
    pass
except KeyboardInterrupt:  # No issue raised but be careful when you do this
    pass

try:
    open("bar.txt", "r")
except BaseException:  # Noncompliant
    pass
except:  # Noncompliant
    pass
----


== Compliant Solution

----
try:
    open("foo.txt", "r")
except SystemExit:
    # clean-up
    raise
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # clean-up
    raise

try:
    open("bar.txt", "r")
except BaseException as e:
    # clean-up
    raise e
except: # Noncompliant
    # clean-up
    raise

# or use a more specific exception

try:
    open("bar.txt", "r")
except FileNotFoundError:
    # process the exception

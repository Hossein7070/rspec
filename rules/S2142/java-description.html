<p>&lt;code&gt;InterruptedExceptions&lt;/code&gt; should never be ignored in the code, and simply logging the exception counts in this case as "ignoring". The throwing of the &lt;code&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/code&gt; clears the interrupted state of the Thread, so if the exception is not handled properly the fact that the thread was interrupted will be lost. Instead, &lt;code&gt;InterruptedExceptions&lt;/code&gt; should either be rethrown - immediately or after cleaning up the method’s state - or the thread should be re-interrupted by calling &lt;code&gt;Thread.interrupt()&lt;/code&gt; even if this is supposed to be a single-threaded application. Any other course of action risks delaying thread shutdown and loses the information that the thread was interrupted - probably without finishing its task.</p>
<p>Similarly, the &lt;code&gt;ThreadDeath&lt;/code&gt; exception should also be propagated. According to its JavaDoc:

If &lt;code&gt;ThreadDeath&lt;/code&gt; is caught by a method, it is important that it be rethrown so that the thread actually dies.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public void run () {
  try {
    while (true) {
      // do stuff
    }
  }catch (InterruptedException e) { // Noncompliant; logging is not enough
    LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "Interrupted!", e);
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public void run () {
  try {
    while (true) {
      // do stuff
    }
  }catch (InterruptedException e) {
    LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "Interrupted!", e);
    // Restore interrupted state...
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
  }
}
</pre>

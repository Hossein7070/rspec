User provided data, such as URL parameters, POST data payloads, or cookies, should always be considered untrusted and tainted. A remote server making requests to URLs based on tainted data could enable attackers to make arbitrary requests to the internal network or to the local file system.

The problem could be mitigated in any of the following ways:
* Validate the user provided data based on a whitelist and reject input not matching.
* Redesign the application to not send requests based on user provided data.

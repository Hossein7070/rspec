<p>Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard the control flow of a block of code is to understand. Expressions with high Cognitive Complexity will be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Because boolean expressions become more difficult to understand with mixed operators, Cognitive complexity increments for each new sequence of like operators. Note that parenthesises and &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; operators break a sequence of operators and thus increment cognitive complexity.</p>

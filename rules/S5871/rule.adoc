Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard the control flow of a block of code is to understand. Expressions with high Cognitive Complexity will be difficult to maintain.

Because boolean expressions become more difficult to understand with mixed operators, Cognitive complexity increments for each new sequence of like operators. Note that parenthesises and <code>not</code> operators break a sequence of operators and thus increment cognitive complexity.

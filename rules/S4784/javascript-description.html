<p>Using regular expressions is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16021">CVE-2017-16021</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13863">CVE-2018-13863</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluating regular expressions against input strings is potentially an extremely CPU-intensive task. Specially crafted regular expressions such as &lt;code&gt;(a+)\+s&lt;/code&gt; will take several seconds to evaluate the input string &lt;code&gt;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabs&lt;/code&gt;. The problem is that with every additional &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; character added to the input, the time required to evaluate the regex doubles. However, the equivalent regular expression, &lt;code&gt;a\+s&lt;/code&gt; (without grouping) is efficiently evaluated in milliseconds and scales linearly with the input size.
Evaluating such regular expressions opens the door to <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS">Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</a> attacks. In the context of a web application, attackers can force the web server to spend all of its resources evaluating regular expressions thereby making the service inaccessible to genuine users.</p>
<p>This rule flags any execution of a hardcoded regular expression which has at least 3 characters and at least two instances of any of the following characters: &lt;code&gt;*+\{&lt;/code&gt;.
Example: &lt;code&gt;(a+)\*&lt;/code&gt;</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
<li>the executed regular expression is sensitive and a user can provide a string which will be analyzed by this regular expression.</li>
<li>your regular expression engine performance decrease with specially crafted inputs and regular expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Check whether your regular expression engine (the algorithm executing your regular expression) has any known vulnerabilities. Search for vulnerability reports mentioning the one engine you’re are using.</p>
<p>Use if possible a library which is not vulnerable to Redos Attacks such as <a href="https://github.com/google/re2">Google Re2</a>.</p>
<p>Remember also that a ReDos attack is possible if a user-provided regular expression is executed. This rule won’t detect this kind of injection.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
const regex = /(a+)+b/; // Sensitive
const regex2 = new RegExp("(a+)+b"); // Sensitive

str.search("(a+)+b"); // Sensitive
str.match("(a+)+b"); // Sensitive
str.split("(a+)+b"); // Sensitive
</pre>
<p>Note: String.matchAll does not raise any issue as it is not supported by NodeJS.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Some corner-case regular expressions will not raise an issue even though they might be vulnerable. For example: &lt;code&gt;(a|aa)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(a|a?)&lt;/code&gt;.
It is a good idea to test your regular expression if it has the same pattern on both side of a "&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;".</p>

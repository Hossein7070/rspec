== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Check whether your regular expression engine (the algorithm executing your regular expression) has any known vulnerabilities. Search for vulnerability reports mentioning the one engine you're are using.

Use if possible a library which is not vulnerable to Redos Attacks such as https://github.com/google/re2[Google Re2].

Remember also that a ReDos attack is possible if a user-provided regular expression is executed. This rule won't detect this kind of injection.

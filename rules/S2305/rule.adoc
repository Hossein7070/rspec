The <code>iostream.h</code> header was provided with the first C++ compiler, CFront, and became the de facto standard. During the formal standardization process of C++, many shortcomings in <code>iostream.h</code> were fixed, but at the cost of introducing incompatibilities. Therefore, it was decided not to change the existing <code>iostream.h</code> and introduce the standard version as a new <code>iostream</code> header.

Modern compilers tend to remove the support of the legacy <code>iostream.h</code> header, and migrating to the standard version is encouraged.

This rule applies not only to <code>iostream</code>, but to all standard C++ headers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
#include <iostream.h> // Noncompliant
#include <fstream.h>  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

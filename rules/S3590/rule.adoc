Stack allocated memory, like memory allocated with the functions <code>alloca</code>, <code>\_alloca</code>, <code>\_malloca</code>, <code>\_\_builtin\_alloca</code>, is automatically released at the end of the function, and should not be released with <code>free</code>. Explicitly <code>free</code>-ing such memory results in undefined behavior.

This rule raises issues when trying to release pointers to memory which is not owned, like stack allocated memory and function pointers.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void fun() {
  char *name = (char *) alloca(size);
  // ...
  free(name); // Noncompliant, memory allocated on the stack
  char *name2 = "name";
  // ...
  free(name2); // Noncompliant, memory allocated on the stack
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void fun() {
  char *name = (char *) alloca(size);
  // ...
  char *name2 = "name";
  // ...
}
----

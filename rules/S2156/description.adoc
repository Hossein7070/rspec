The difference between <code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> visibility is that child classes can see and use <code>protected</code> members, but they cannot see <code>private</code> ones. Since a <code>final</code> class will have no children, marking the members of a <code>final</code> class <code>protected</code> is confusingly pointless.

Note that the <code>protected</code> members of a class can also be seen and used by other classes that are placed within the same package, this could lead to accidental, unintended access to otherwise private members.

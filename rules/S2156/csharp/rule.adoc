The difference between <code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> visibility is that child classes can see and use <code>protected</code> members, but they cannot see <code>private</code> ones. Since a <code>sealed</code> class cannot have children, marking its members <code>protected</code> is confusingly pointless.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public sealed class MySealedClass 
{
    protected string name = "Fred";  // Noncompliant
    protected void SetName(string name) // Noncompliant
    {
        // ...
    }
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public sealed class MySealedClass 
{
    private string name = "Fred";
    public void SetName(string name)
    {
        // ...
    }
}

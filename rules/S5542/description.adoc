To perform secure cryptography, operation modes and padding scheme are essentials and should be used correctly according to the encryption algorithm:

* For block cipher encryption algorithms (like AES), the GCM (Galois Counter Mode) mode, which https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode#Mathematical_basis[works internally] with zero/no padding scheme, is recommended. At the opposite, these modes and/or schemes are highly discouraged:
** Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode is vulnerable because it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality: under a given key any given plaintext block always gets encrypted to the same ciphertext block.
** Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) with PKCS#5 padding (or PKCS#7) is susceptible to padding oracle attacks.

* RSA encryption algorithm should be used with the recommended padding scheme (OAEP)

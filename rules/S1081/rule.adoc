When using legacy C functions, it's up to the developer to make sure the size of the buffer to be written to is large enough to avoid buffer overflows. Buffer overflows can cause the program to crash at a minimum. At worst, a carefully crafted overflow can cause malicious code to be executed.

This rule reports use of the following insecure functions: <code>sprintf()</code>, <code>gets()</code> and <code>getpw()</code>.

In such cases, it's better to use an alternate, secure function which allows you to define the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer:

* <code>snprintf</code>
* <code>fgets</code>
* <code>getpwuid</code>


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
sprintf(str, "%s", message);   // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
snprintf(str, sizeof(str), "%s", message);
----

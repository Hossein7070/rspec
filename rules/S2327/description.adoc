When multiple, adjacent <code>try</code> statements have duplicate <code>catch</code> and/or <code>finally</code> blocks, they should be merged to consolidate the <code>catch/finally</code> logic for cleaner, more readable code. Note that this applies even when there is intervening code outside any <code>try</code> block.

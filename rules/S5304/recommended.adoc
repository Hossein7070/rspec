== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Sanitize every environment variable before using its value.

If you store sensitive information in an environment variable, make sure that no other process can access them, i.e. the process runs with a separate user account and child processes don't have access to their parent's environment.

Don't run your application in debug mode if it has access to sensitive information, including environment variables.

Using environment variables is security-sensitive. For example, their use has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278[CVE-2014-6278]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3464[CVE-2019-3464]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000402[CVE-2018-1000402]
* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10530[CVE-2016-10530]

Environment variables  are sensitive to injection attacks, just like any other input.

Note also that environment variables can be exposed in multiple ways, storing sensitive information in them should be done carefully:

* on Unix systems environment variables of one process can be read by another process running with the same UID.
* environment variables https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/env.html[might be forwarded to child processes].
* application running in debug mode often exposes their environment variable.

This rule raises an issue when environment variables are read.

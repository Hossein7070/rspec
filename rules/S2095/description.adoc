Connections, streams, files, and other classes that implement the <code>Closeable</code> interface or its super-interface, <code>AutoCloseable</code>, needs to be closed after use. Further, that <code>close</code> call must be made in a <code>finally</code> block otherwise an exception could keep the call from being made. Preferably, when class implements <code>AutoCloseable</code>, resource should be created using "try-with-resources" pattern and will be closed automatically.

Failure to properly close resources will result in a resource leak which could bring first the application and then perhaps the box it's on to their knees.

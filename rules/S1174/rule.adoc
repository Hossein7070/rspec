The contract of the <code>Object.finalize()</code> method is clear: only the Garbage Collector is supposed to call this method.
Making this method public is misleading, because it implies that any caller can use it.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public class MyClass {

  @Override
  public void finalize() {    // Noncompliant
    /* ... */
  }
}

There's no point in having a test class without any test methods.This could lead a maintainer to assume a class is covered by tests even though it is not.

Supported test frameworks are <code>NUnit</code> and <code>MSTest</code> (not applicable to <code>xUnit</code>).
This rule will raise an issue when any of these conditions are met:

* For *NUnit*, a class is marked with <code>TestFixture</code> but does not contain any method marked with <code>Test</code>, <code>TestCase</code>, <code>TestCaseSource</code> or <code>Theory</code>.
* For *MSTest*, a class is marked with <code>TestClass</code> but does not contain any method marked with <code>TestMethod</code> or <code>DataTestMethod</code>.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
[TestFixture]
public class SomeClassTest { } // Noncompliant - no test

[TestClass]
public class SomeOtherClassTest { } // Noncompliant - no test
----

== Compliant Solution

----
[TestFixture]
public class SomeClassTest
{
    [Test]
    public void SomeMethodShouldReturnTrue() { }
}

[TestClass]
public class SomeOtherClassTest
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void SomeMethodShouldReturnTrue() { }
}
----

== Exceptions

* abstract classes
* derived classes that inherit from a base class that does have test methods
* in *MSTest*, classes that contain methods marked with either <code>AssemblyInitialize</code> or <code>AssemblyCleanup</code>.

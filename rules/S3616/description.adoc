The comma operator (<code>,</code>) evaluates its operands, from left to right, and returns the second one. That's useful in some situations, but just wrong in a <code>switch</code> <code>case</code>. You may think you're compactly handling multiple values in the case, but only the last one in the comma-list will ever be handled. The rest will fall through to the default.

Similarly the logical OR operator (<code>||</code>) will not work in a <code>switch</code> <code>case</code>, only the first argument will be considered at execution time.

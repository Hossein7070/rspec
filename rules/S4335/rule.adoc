An intersection type combines multiple types into one. This allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need. However an intersection with a type without members doesn't change the resulting type. In the opposite the usage of <code>any</code> or <code>never</code> as part of an intersection will always results in <code>any</code> or <code>never</code> respectively. This is almost certainly an error.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
function foo(p: MyType & null) { // Noncompliant
 // ...
}

function bar(p: MyType & any) { // Noncompliant
 // ...
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
function foo(p: MyType | null) {
 // ...
}
// or
function foo(p: MyType & AnotherType) {
 // ...
}

function bar(p: any) {
 // ...
}
----

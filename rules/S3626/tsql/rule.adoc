Jump statements, such as <code>RETURN</code> and <code>CONTINUE</code> let you change the default flow of program execution, but jump statements that direct the control flow to the original direction are just a waste of keystrokes.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
CREATE PROCEDURE MyProc
AS
  DECLARE @return_status int = 0;  
  WHILE @return_status = 0
  BEGIN
    EXEC @return_status = something;
    CONTINUE; -- Noncompliant
  END;
  RETURN; -- Noncompliant
GO

== Compliant Solution

----
CREATE PROCEDURE MyProc
AS
  DECLARE @return_status int = 0;  
  WHILE @return_status = 0
  BEGIN
    EXEC @return_status = something;
  END;

<p>Defining and using global variables and global functions, when the convention dictates OOP can be confusing and difficult to use properly for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You run the risk of name clashes.</li>
<li>Global functions must be stateless, or they can cause difficult-to-track bugs.</li>
<li>Global variables can be updated from anywhere and may no longer hold the value you expect.</li>
<li>It is difficult to properly test classes that use global functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of being declared globally, such variables and functions should be moved into a class, potentially marked &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;, so they can be used without a class instance.</p>
<p>This rule  checks that only object-oriented programming is used and that no functions or procedures are declared outside of a class.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var name = "Bob"    // Noncompliant

func doSomething() {   // Noncompliant
  //...
}

class MyClass {
    //...
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  public static var name = "Bob"

  public class func doSomething() {              // Compliant
    //...
  }
  //...
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>The operator function is a function with a name that matches the operator to be overloaded. Because such functions can only be defined in a global scope, they are ignored by this rule.</p>
<pre>
public class Vector2D {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    // ...
}

func + (left: Vector2D, right: Vector2D) -&gt; Vector2D {
    return Vector2D(x: left.x + right.x, y: left.y + right.y)
}
</pre>

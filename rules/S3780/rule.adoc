It is unsafe to have <code>const</code> string reference members as they can be created from a temporary quite easily.

----
struct Foo {
  Foo(const string &Str) : Str(Str) {}
  const string &Str;
};
Foo instance("string");
----
When the constructor is called, a string temporary is created from <code>const char *</code> and destroyed immediately after. This results in a dangling reference.

This rule applies for both <code>std::string</code> and <code>::string</code> <code>const</code> reference members.

Executing a <code>DELETE</code> statement without a <code>WHERE</code> clause will delete all rows in a table.

If that is truly what is intended, the <code>TRUNCATE</code> statement should be used because it is faster and uses fewer system and transaction log resources. Moreover when using the <code>TRUNCATE</code> statement, there is no ambiguity about the purpose of the SQL statement.

If removing all content from the table is not what is intended, a <code>WHERE</code> clause should be added.

Arbitrary OS commands can be executed by an attacker when:
* The OS command name to execute is user-controlled.
* A shell is spawn rather than a new process, in this case shell meta-chars can be used (when parameters are user-controlled for instance) to inject OS commands.
* The executable is searched in the directories specified by the PATH variable (which can contain user-controlled or malicious directories).

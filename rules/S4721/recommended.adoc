== Recommended Secure Coding Practices

* User-controlled inputs should not be used, for any reasons, to build a dynamically OS command (command name or even parameters when shell is used).
* Fully qualified/absolute path should be used to specify the OS command to execute.
* If possible, set the lowest privileges to the new process/shell in which commands are executed.
* If possible, execute the OS commands in an isolated environment.

For C compatibility, it is possible in C++ for a name to refer to both a type and object or a type and function. This can lead to confusion.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
typedef struct vector {
  // ...
} vector; // Noncompliant, 'vector' is both a tag name and a typedef name.

struct vector {
  // ...
} vector; // Noncompliant, 'vector' is both a tag name and a variable.
----


== Compliant Solution

----
typedef struct vector {
  // ...
} vector_t; // Compliant

vector_t vector; // Compliant
----

<p>Since an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; is a 32-bit variable, shifting by more than +/-31 is confusing at best and an error at worst. When the runtime shifts 32-bit integers, it uses the lowest 5 bits of the shift count operand. In other words, shifting an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; by 32 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 33 is the same as shifting it by 1.</p>
<p>Similarly, when shifting 64-bit integers, the runtime uses the lowest 6 bits of the shift count operand and shifting &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; by 64 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 65 is the same as shifting it by 1.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public int shift(int a) {
  int x = a &gt;&gt; 32; // Noncompliant
  return a &lt;&lt; 48;  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public int shift(int a) {
  int x = a &gt;&gt; 31;
  return a &lt;&lt; 16;
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This rule doesnâ€™t raise an issue when the shift by zero is obviously for cosmetic reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the value shifted is a literal.</li>
<li>When there is a similar shift at the same position on line before or after. E.g.:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
bytes[loc+0] = (byte)(value &gt;&gt; 8);
bytes[loc+1] = (byte)(value &gt;&gt; 0);
</pre>

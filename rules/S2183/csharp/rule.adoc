Shifting an integral number by 0 is equivalent to doing nothing but makes the code confusing for maintainers.

If the first operand is an <code>int</code> or <code>uint</code> (32-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order five bits of the second operand. That is, the actual shift count is 0 to 31 bits.
Note that integral number with a less than 32-bit quantity (e.g. <code>short</code>, <code>ushort</code>...) are implicitly converted to <code>int</code> before the shifting operation and so the rule for <code>int</code>/<code>uint</code> applies.

If the first operand is a <code>long</code> or <code>ulong</code> (64-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order six bits of the second operand. That is, the actual shift count is 0 to 63 bits.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
public void Main() 
{
    short s = 1;
    short shortShift1 = (short)(s << 0); // Noncompliant    
    short shortShift1 = (short)(s << 16); // Compliant as short will be cast to int (16 is between 0 and 31)
    short shortShift3 = (short)(s << 32); // Noncompliant, this is equivalent to shifting by 1

    int i = 1;
    int intShift1 = i << 0; // Noncompliant    
    int intShift2 = i << 32; // Noncompliant, this is equivalent to shifting by 1

    long lg = 1;
    long longShift1 = lg << 0; // Noncompliant
    long longShift2 = lg << 64; // Noncompliant, this is equivalent to shifting by 1
}
----

== Compliant Solution

----
public void Main() 
{
    short s = 1;
    short shortShift1 = s;
    short shortShift1 = (short)(s << 16); 
    short shortShift3 = (short)(s << 1);

    int i = 1;
    var intShift1 = i; 
    var intShift2 = i << 1;

    long lg = 1;
    var longShift1 = lg;
    var longShift2 = lg << 1;
}

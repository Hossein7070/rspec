Since an <code>int</code> is a 32-bit variable, shifting by more than +/-31 is confusing at best and an error at worst. When the runtime shifts 32-bit integers, it uses the lowest 5 bits of the shift count operand. In other words, shifting an <code>int</code> by 32 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 33 is the same as shifting it by 1.

Similarly, when shifting 64-bit integers, the runtime uses the lowest 6 bits of the shift count operand and shifting <code>long</code> by 64 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 65 is the same as shifting it by 1.

While it is legal to place <code>#define</code> and <code>#undef</code> directives anywhere in a source file, placing them outside of the global namespace is misleading since their scope is not actually restricted. This may be inconsistent with developer expectations.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
namespace NS
{
  #ifndef MY_HDR
  #define MY_HDR    /* Noncompliant */
  #undef FOO        /* Noncompliant */
  #endif
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
#ifndef MY_HDR
#define MY_HDR
#undef FOO
#endif
----


== See

* MISRA C:2004, 19.5 - Macros shall not be #define'd or #undef'd within a block.
* MISRA C++:2008, 16-0-2 - Macros shall only be #define'd or #undef'd in the global namespace.

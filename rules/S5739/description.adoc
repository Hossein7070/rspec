When implementing the HTTPS protocol, the website mostly continue to support the HTTP protocol to redirect users to HTTPS when they request a HTTP version of the website. These redirects are not encrypted and are therefore vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[Strict-Transport-Security policy header] (HSTS) set by an application instructs the web browser to convert any HTTP request to HTTPS.

Web browsers that see the Strict-Transport-Security policy header for the first time record information specified in the header:

* the <code>max-age</code> directive which specify how long the policy should be kept on the web browser.
* the <code>includeSubDomains</code> optional directive which specify if the policy should apply on all sub-domains or not.
* the <code>preload</code> optional directive which is not part of the HSTS specification but supported on all modern web browsers.

With the <code>preload</code> directive the web browser never connects in HTTP to the website and to use this directive, it is required https://hstspreload.org/[to submit] the concerned application to a preload service maintained by Google.

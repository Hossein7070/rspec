<p>There is potential for confusion if an octal or hexadecimal escape sequence is immediately followed by other characters. Instead, such sequences should be terminated by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The start of another escape sequence.</li>
<li>The end of the string.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
String hasHex = "\x41g";  // Noncompliant
String hasOct = '\141t'; // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
String hasHex = "\x41" + "g"; // Compliant - terminated by end of literal
String hasOct = "\x41\x67"; // Compliant - terminated by another escape
</pre>

Using <code>TOP</code> in a <code>SELECT</code> without ordering the results from which the "top" results are chosen will return a seemingly random set of rows, and is surely a mistake.
The same random behavior also occurs when using <code>TOP</code> in a <code>DELETE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>MERGE</code>.

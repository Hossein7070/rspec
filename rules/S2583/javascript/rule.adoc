== Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue in either of these cases:
* When the condition is a single <code>const</code> of boolean value
----
const debug = false;
//...
if (debug) {
  // Print something
}
----
* When the condition is the literal <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.

In these cases it is obvious the code is as intended.

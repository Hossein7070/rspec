When either the equality operator in a null test or the logical operator that follows it is reversed, the code has the appearance of safely null-testing the object before dereferencing it. Unfortunately the effect is just the opposite - the object is null-tested and then dereferenced _only_ if it is null, leading to a guaranteed null pointer dereference.

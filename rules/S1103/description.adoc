Defining a nested single-line comment within a multi-line comment invites errors. It may lead a developer to wrongly think that the lines located after the single-line comment are not part of the comment.

If a comment starting sequence, <code>/*</code> or <code>//</code>, occurs within a <code>/*</code> comment, is it quite likely to be caused by a missing <code>*/</code> comment ending sequence.
If a comment starting sequence occurs within a <code>//</code> comment, it is probably because a region of code has been commented-out using <code>//</code>.

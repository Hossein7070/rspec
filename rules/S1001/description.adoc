"using-directives" add additional scopes to the set of scopes searched during name lookup. All identifiers in these scopes become visible. If two different namespaces contain some identifiers with same names then it can quickly become error-prone as it increases the possibility that the identifier found by the compiler does not meet developer expectations. This rule raises an issue as soon a "using" directive leads to introduce an ambiguity.

While C syntax considers array subscripts (<code>[]</code>) as symmetrical, meaning that <code>a[i]</code> and <code>i[a]</code> are equivalent, the convention is to put the index in the brackets rather than the array name. Inverting the index and array name serves no purpose, and is very confusing.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
10[P1] = 0; // Noncompliant
dostuff(i[arr]); // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
P1[10] = 0;
dostuff(arr[i]);
----

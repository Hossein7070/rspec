<p>This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when the full content of a comment matches a given regular expression. Note that the regular expression should be expressed using the dotall format (where the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; character matches any character).</p>
<p>For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression &lt;code&gt;.<strong>REVIEW.</strong>&lt;/code&gt; to match all comment containing "REVIEW".</p>
<p>Note that, in order to match REVIEW regardless of the case, the &lt;code&gt;(?i)&lt;/code&gt; modifier should be prepended to the expression, as in &lt;code&gt;(?i).<strong>REVIEW.</strong>&lt;/code&gt;.</p>

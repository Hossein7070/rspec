<p>This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when a comment matches a given regular expression.
For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression &lt;code&gt;.<strong>REVIEW.</strong>&lt;/code&gt; to match all comment containing "REVIEW".</p>
<p>Note that, in order to match REVIEW regardless of the case, the &lt;code&gt;(?i)&lt;/code&gt; modifier should be prepended to the expression, as in &lt;code&gt;(?i).<strong>REVIEW.</strong>&lt;/code&gt;.</p>

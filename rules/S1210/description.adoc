According to the Java <code>Comparable.compareTo(T o)</code> documentation:

{quote}
It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that <code>(x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</code>.
Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
The recommended language is "Note: this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals."

If this rule is violated, weird and unpredictable failures can occur.
For example, in Java 5 the <code>PriorityQueue.remove()</code> method relied on <code>compareTo()</code>, but since Java 6 it has relied on <code>equals()</code>.

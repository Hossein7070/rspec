Validation of X.509 certificates is essential to create secure SSL/TLS sessions not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. 
The certificate chain validation includes these steps:

* The certificate is issued by its parent Certificate Authority or the root CA trusted by the system.
* Each CA is allowed to issue certificates.
* Each certificate in the chain is not expired.

It's not recommended to reinvent the wheel by implementing custom certificate chain validation.
TLS libraries provide built-in certificate validation functions that should be used.

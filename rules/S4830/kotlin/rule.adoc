Validation of X.509 certificates is essential to create secure SSL/TLS sessions not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. 
The certificate chain validation includes these steps:

* The certificate is issued by its parent Certificate Authority or the root CA trusted by the system.
* Each CA is allowed to issue certificates.
* Each certificate in the chain is not expired.

This rule raises an issue when an implementation of X509TrustManager is not controlling the validity of the certificate (ie: no exception is raised). Empty implementations of the <code>X509TrustManager</code> interface are often created to disable certificate validation. The correct solution is to provide an appropriate trust store.

== Noncompliant Code Example

----
 // Create a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains
val trustAllCerts = arrayOf<TrustManager>(object : X509TrustManager {
  @Throws(CertificateException::class)
   override fun checkClientTrusted(chain: Array<java.security.cert.X509Certificate>, authType: String) {
  } // Noncompliant

  @Throws(CertificateException::class)
    override fun checkServerTrusted(chain: Array<java.security.cert.X509Certificate>, authType: String) {
   } // Noncompliant

  override fun getAcceptedIssuers(): Array<java.security.cert.X509Certificate> {
   return arrayOf()
  } 
 })

 // Install the all-trusting trust manager
val sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL")
sslContext.init(null, trustAllCerts, java.security.SecureRandom())
----

== Compliant Solution

----
val sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL")
sslContext.init(null, null, java.security.SecureRandom())
----

Before C++11, <code>auto</code> was used as a storage class specifier that indicated automatic duration. Since that's the default, the use of <code>auto</code> in that context was wholly redundant.

Because the keyword was redundant and therefore rarely used, C++11 repurposes it. <code>auto</code> is now used to specify that the type of the variable or function should be deduced from its context.

Since it is redundant under older standards and problematic under C++11, <code>auto</code>'s use as a storage-class identifier should be removed.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
auto int x; // Noncompliant: redundant before C++11, error as of C++11

auto int y;  // Noncompliant
----


== Compliant Solution

----
int x;

auto y = 1 + 2; // C++11: type of 'y' will be inferred
----

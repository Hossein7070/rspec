Some signed to unsigned conversions may lead to implementation-defined behaviour. This behaviour may not be consistent with developer expectations.

If you need to mix signed and unsigned types, you should used explicit casts to clarify your intent.


== Noncompliant Code Example

----
void f(int a) {
  unsigned int b = a; // Noncompliant
  int c = (a > 0) ? a : b; // Noncompliant  

  if (a > b) { // Noncompliant
    // ...
  }
}
----


== Compliant Solution

----
void f(int a) {
  unsigned int b = static_cast<unsigned int>(a); // Compliant
}
----
